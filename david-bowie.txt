I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
You caught yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex
Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me deadWatching him dash away, 
swinging an old bouquet 
- dead roses
Sake and strange divine Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you'll make it
Passionate bright young things, 
takes him away to war - 
don't fake it
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you'll make it

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise
Who'll love Aladdin Sane

Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, 
just in case of sunrise

Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

Who'll love Aladdin Sane
Millions weep a fountain, 
just in case of sunrise

Who'll love Aladdin Sane

We'll love Aladdin Sane
We'll love Aladdin SaneI've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had

I'm stiff on my legend, 
the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty 
cause you just got paid

[CHORUS]
Crack, baby, crack, 
show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck,
give me your head
Before you start professing 
that you're knocking me dead

You caught yourself a trick down 
on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby
you're a porcupine

You sold me illusions for a sack full of cheques
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex

[CHORUS]Let me put my arms 
around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see
if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone

And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes
and scored
Like the video films we saw

[CHORUS]
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday

Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation 
amid this fall out saturation

Cursing at the Astronette 8
Who stands in steel 
by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply 
for ageing men

With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Which once had raised a sea
that raged no more
Like the video films we saw

[CHORUS]
It's a Drive-in Saturday [repeat]She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
Skin sweet with musky oil
The lady from another grinning soul

Cologne she'll wear. Silver and Americard
She'll drive a beetle car
And beat you down at cool Canasta

And when the clothes are strewn
don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end

She'll come, she'll go.
She'll lay belief on you
But she won't stake her life on you
How can life become 
her point of view

And when the clothes are strewn 
don't be afraid of the room
Touch the fullness of her breast. 
Feel the love of her caress
She will be your living end [repeat]Well, don't you worry 'bout what's been on my mind
I'm in no hurry 
I can take my time
I'm going red 
and my tongue's getting tired
Out of my head and my mouth's getting dry
I'm h-h-h-high

[CHORUS]
Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever
Let's spend the night together now

I feel so strong
that I can't disguise, oh my
Well, I just can't apologise, no
Don't hang me up but don't let me down
We could have fun just by fooling around, and around 
and around

[CHORUS]

Oh, You know I'm smiling baby
You need some guiding baby
I'm just deciding baby

[CHORUS]

This doesn't happen to me every day
No excuses I've got anyway, heh
I'll satisfy your every need
And I'll know you'll satisfy me, oh my-my-my my-my

Let's spend the night together
Now I need you more than ever [x3]

Let's spend the night together
They said we were too young
Our kind of love 
was no fun
But our love 
comes from above
Do it!
Let's make love
Hoo!

[CHORUS]He looked a lot like Che Guevara, 
drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion,
such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening 
gloom
The police had warned of repercussions

They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone

Panic in Detroit

Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
And I found my teacher
crouching in his overalls

I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights

Having scored a trillion dollars, 
made a run back home

Found him slumped across the table. 
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window. Looked for a plane or two
Panic in Detroit. 
He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust." 
I wish someone would phone

Panic in DetroitA small Jean Genie
snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers 
and slash back blazers
Ate all your razors 
while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe 
and walking on Snow White 19
New York's a go-go 19
and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie

[CHORUS]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!

Sits like a man 
but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but 
just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, 
won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician
and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair 
for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[CHORUS]

He's so simple minded 
he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved

[CHORUS (x2)]Cold fire, you've got everything 
but cold fire
You will be my rest and peace child
I moved up to take a place near you

So tired, it's the sky that makes you feel tired
It's a trick to make you see wide
It can all but break your heart in pieces

[CHORUS]
Staying back in your memory
Are the movies in the past
How you moved is all it takes
To sing a song of when I loved
The Prettiest Star

One day though it might 
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest Star

[CHORUS]

One day though it might
as well be someday
You and I will rise up all the way
All because of what you are
The Prettiest StarTime - He's waiting in the wings
He speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys

Time - He flexes like a whore
Falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy

Time - In Quaaludes and red wine
Demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine
Take your time

The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain, 
and many other last names
I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think 
"Oh God I'm still alive"

We should be on by now [x2]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la [repeat]

You - are not a victim
You - just scream with boredom
You - are not evicting time

Chimes - Goddamn, you're looking old
You'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind
Take your time

Breaking up is hard, but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams, 
I had so many breakthroughs
But you, my love, were kind, but love has left you 
dreamless
The door to dreams was closed. 
Your park was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now, 
smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was the guilt for dreaming

We should be on by now [x5]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la [repeat]

Yeah, time!Shakey threw a party 
that lasted all night
Everybody drank a lot of something nice
There was an old fashioned band 
of married men
Looking up to me 
for encouragement 
- it was so-so

The ladies looked bad 
but the music was sad
No one took their eyes off Lorraine
She shimmered and she strolled like a Chicago moll
Her feathers looked better and better 
- it was so-so

Yea! it was time to unfreeze
When the Reverend Alabaster danced on his knees
Slam! so it wasn't a game
Cracking all the mirrors in shame

[CHORUS]
Watch that man!3 Oh honey, watch that man
He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and 
spoon
Watch that man! Oh honey, watch that man
He walks like a jerk
But he's only taking care of the room
Must be in tune

A Benny Goodman 1fan painted holes in his hands
So Shakey hung him up to dry
The pundits3were joking 
the manholes were smoking
And every bottle battled
with the reason why

The girl on the phone wouldn't leave me alone
A throw back from someone's LP
A lemon in a bag played 
the Tiger Rag3 
And the bodies on the screen stopped bleeding

Yeah! I was shaking like a leaf
For I couldn't understand the conversation
Yeah! I ran to the street, looking for information

[CHORUS]

Watch that man [repeat ad inf.]Woo
Thaaa
Thaaa
Always in trouble
Never to blame
Must be a double
You are the same
Here it comes again
Doing the wrong thing
Forgetting your li..ines
Waiting for something
better to shine
Take that same okay
After today,
fortune man will find you
After today,
they will find you working
After today,
you'll find the ones you're after
After today,
look out, after today
What kind of rescue?
What will you be?
Where can you take it, baby boy?
Me...
Break that heart, boy!
{Chorus}
After today,
your fortune fan will find you
After today,
they may pry you away
After today,
you'll find the one you're after
After today,
look out, after today
{chorus}
Today
After today
After toda-ay, hey
Look out, after today
Ah, yeah
Look, ah (laughter)
(spoken : I was gettin' in ta that)
(laughter)Getting my facts from a Benetton ad 
I'm lookin' thru African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang 
Bang I've got you babe
Sun comes up and the man goes down 
And the woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear
Then we jump thru hoops, we're
divisible now, just disappear
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "we
shall overcome"
Whoa! What's going on
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know
you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I look into your eyes
And I wonder sometimes

Oh Lord, just let him see me 
Lord, Lord just let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together.

Reach over race and hold each
other's hands
Walk thru the nite thinking we are the world
Woa! What's going on
There'll be some blood no doubt about it 
But we'll come thru don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me
But I wonder why
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes 

They'll show us how to break the rules 
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
Facist cries both black and 
white, who's got the blood, 
who's got the gun.

Putting on the black tie, cranking 
out the white noise
(Just a fool!)Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

I know there's something in the wind
That crazy balance of my mind
What kind of fool are you and I
Scared to death and tell me why
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down

Still I keep my love for you

You made a date with destiny
You jog-jog in my memory
You haunt in mind not fade away
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and down
I'm sick and tired of telling you

Still I keep my love for you
No place to hide, no way to fall
Nowhere to lie no world so wide
I'm sick and tired of telling you
Don't let me down and down and down
Don't let me down and down and downDear when I dance with you
We move like the sea
You, you're all I want to know
I feel free
I feel free

[CHORUS (2 times)]
I can walk down the street
there's no one there 
the pavement is one huge crowd
I can drive down the road
my eyes can't see 
but my mind wants to cry out loud

I feel free

Dance floor is like the sea
The ceiling is the sky
You're the sun, and as you shine on me
I feel free [3 times]My love wherever you are
Whatever you are, don't lose faith
I know it's gonna happen someday to you
Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
You say that the day never arrives
And it's never seemed so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday to you

Please wait
Please wait
Wait, don't lose faith
Please wait
Please wait
Please, don't lose faith
Don't lose faith

You say that the day never arrives
And it seems so far away
But I know it's gonna happen someday
Someday to you
To you
Please waitWhen comes the shaking man
A nation in his eyes
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo
Streaking cathedral spire

They say
he has no brain
They say
he has no mood
They say
he was born again
They say
look at him climb
They say 'Jump'

They say
he has two gods
They say
he has no fear
They say
he has no eyes
They say
he has no mouth

They say hey that's really something
They feel he should get some time
I say he should watch his ass
My friend don't listen to the crowd
They say 'Jump'
Got to believe somebody
Got to believeLucy I know what you're going to going to do
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways
I say trust Him at once which is something these days

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she 
knows what the noise 
can do [x2]

Did the world just explode
Don't recognize anyone
But you've still got me under your thumb

Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise 
can do

Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy
In this sexual noise, vicious chords 
offer joy
You live and you die in the blink of an eye
Well I can't make you dance 
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do
[x2]
Dance to the noise

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do
But you can't buy me off in this serial world
Who who who died and made you material girl
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she 
knows what the noise 
can do

So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric
goes wrong
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern
song
Lucy can't dance to the noise but 
she knows what the noise 
can do

Or this shallow orb mugged by reality
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need
you
Live and you die in the blink of an eye
Still I can't make you dance
Dance to the noise

Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can doBurning up each others' love, burning up our lives
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight
Future full and empty knocking on my door
Ragged limbed and hungry mama 
Miracle no more

(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight
Evening flower all alone, pazanane capeche
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more

[CHORUS]
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Head tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight
(Breath tell me) turn it around
(Heart tell me) make it all right
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe

I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here
I wished I had a future, anywhere

I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight

[CHORUS]

Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal
I really don't want to know that 
The less we know, the better we feel

Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high
Spinning around my little room, miracle

[CHORUS]
(Skin tell me) turn it around
(Moon tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe
(Eyes tell me) turn it around 
(News tell me) make it alright
(Nobody dancing)

[CHORUS]There's no hold
The moving has come through
The danger passing you
Turns its face into the heat and runs the tunnels
It's so cold
The dark dug up by dogs
The stiches torn and broke
The raw meat fist you choke 
Has hit the bloodlite

Glass traps open and close on 
nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to fall

Glass traps open and close on nite flights
Broken necks feather weights press the walls
Be my love, we will be gods on nite flights
With only one promise, only one way to call

On nite flights
Only one way to fallGod is on top of it all
That's all
We are we are we areThese are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm gonna be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm gonna change my ways
Angel for life

Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high 
I'm smiling

I believe in magic
Angel for lifeWhere's the pain in the violent night
I'm depressed by the grin
I stay over many years
I should have thought of that
For the love of the money
Like a black-hearted violin
It's the nature of being

It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell bad from wrong
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me

Where the flesh meets the spirit world
Where the traffic is thin
I slip from a vacant view
I should have thought of that
And the sound of tomorrow
Like a black-hearted vile thing
Like the silence of tension
It's too many lonely nights
I can't tell good from bad
I can't pass you by
Too exchanging
You've been around
But you've changed me
You've been around
Can't pass you by
You've been around
But you've changed me
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-change!
Too exchanging
You've been around 
but you've changed me
You've been around 
can't pass you byWell billy rapped all night about his suicide.
Said he could kick it in the head when he was 25.
Speed jive. Don't wanna stay alive when your 25.
And Wendy's stealing clothes from Marks And Sparks.
And Freddie's got spots from ripping of the stars.
From his face. Funky little boat race.
The television man is crazy.
Saying we're juvenile delequent wrecks.
I need TV when I got T-Rex?
Oh brother you guessed I'm a dude now.
CHORUS:
All the young dudes. Carry the news.
Bugaloo dudes. Carry the news.
Well Billy's looking sweat cuz he dresses like a queen.
But he can kick like a mule it's a real mean team.
But we can love. Ahh yes. We can love.
And my father's back at home with his Beatles and his Stones.
He never got it off with that revolution stuff.
What a drag. Too many snags.
Well I drunk alot of wine and I'm feeling fine.
I'm gonna raise some kind of bet.
Oh man, is this concrete all around or is it in my head.
Brother, I'm a dude now.
CHORUS.Look up I hear the scream of sirens on the wall
I see a policeman crying in the backseat of a dying Ford
Hotel waiters leave the bedrooms of stars
Who are far too old
And no-one ever told me
That I could be so cold
Bombers fight at zero feet
Bombers fight at zero
I see an old man knocked to the ground
And beaten by the vicar's wife
No-one stops to help they're far too busy
Trying to save their own lives
A tiny girl screams for mother
And wanders out into the street
I saw her going down underneath
A thousand people's running feet
Bombers fight at zero feet
Bombers fight at zero
All the junkies pulling needles from their arms
Hope it lasts all night
And all the soldiers curse the day they joined the army
And prepare to fight
In silent bars, in silent rooms, in silent cars
You hide where you can
And me I know just whereyou are, you see
I'm a bomber man
Bombers fight at zero feet
Bombers fight at zeroYou're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you any more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while ya look for a whore
Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
Ya stay for a while, then you pick up and go
{Chorus 1}
That's how you show
your love for me
That's how you show
your love for me
You're like
{Chorus 2}
Here today,
gone tomorrow
Each time you call,
you leave a little sorrow
You're like
{chorus 2}
You're like that big, big star, he's tore the town apart
Givin' everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, then you leave without a trace
That's 'xactly like that star, he tore the town apart
Leave everyone to console their aching heart
Like that snow that fell, looks so wrong and out of place
Stay for a while, leave without a trace

Hmmm, like

{chorus 2}
Yeah
Here today
Here today but gone tomorrow
(spoken: thank you)I try to break away from you
From the spics and blacks and the gum you chew
Where the posters are torn by the muggin' gangs...
By the faggy parks and burnt out va..ans
I've got ninety-nine years of layin' in the dark
and I'm far too young to lie
I've got ninety-nine ways to play my guitar
Its gonna play 'em in before I die
{Chorus}
So bob your sweet head
Brother Ziggy gonna play
I'm just a bob-a-lectic hear
Gonna rock-it in your head
Shazam! and come ball,
where my guitar-um is-a playin'
We can give you sweet head
I'm tough as glass and clean as night
Well, if looks can love, we can love alright
I'm your r-r-r-rubber peacock, angelic whore
I'm a wrought-iron face upon the wall..l..l
I've had ninety-nine tales of murder-come-life,
and I'm running away from it all
I got a bedroom, every mirror in town,
they're gonna claim me if I fall
{chorus}
Sweet head
Gonna give ya sweet head
(spoken: While ya down there)
See my eyes of blocked emotion
See my tremble, see my fall
Traumatic, stinkin' fast
Your faith in me can last
Besides, I'm numb to lay you,
rubbin' all
Look south the way your mother dwells
'Cause if she knew what's going on, she'd give you hell
I'm the kind of man she warned me of
Until there was rock, you only had God
You and I have a mutual vow
We both like gamery, and we both like loud
I got pretty shoes, and I'm kin and proud
I'm street-side-out, with my ear to the crowd
{chorus}
Move along, son
ca-cho, ca-cho
ca-cho, ca-cho
Woo!{Verse 1}
[White light] White light gonna drive me out of my brain
[White light] White light gonna make me feel so insane
[White  heat] White shapin' them down to my toes
[White light] White light's got a nana, goodness knows
{Verse 2}
[White light] White light gonna drive me out of my mind
[White light] White light is surely gonna make me blind
[White  heat] White shaping way down to my toes
[White light] White light could kill me now, goodness knows
{Chorus}
Oh, Oh, White light
Oh, Oh, White light
Oh, Oh, White heat
Oh, Oh, White heat
{verse 1}
[White light] White light has got it now, goodness knows
{verse 2}
{chorus}
{chorus}
White light's a-flashin'
White light
Don't feel sorry
What's that sound, what's that sound,
don't turn on, be deader alive
No feelin'
Here she comes
Oww, yeah
[Oh, oh, oh, oh] here she comes
[Oh, oh, oh, oh]
[Ah, ah, ah, ah]I
I will be king
And you
You will be queen
Though nothing will
Drive them away
We can beat them
Just for one day
We can be heroes
Just for one day
And you
You can be mean
And I
I can drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers
And that's a fact
Yes we're lovers
And that is that
Though nothing
Will keep us together
We could steal time
Just for one day
We can be heroes
For ever and ever
What d'you say
Du
Kanntest du schwimmen
Wie Delphine
Delphine es tun
Niemand gibt us eine Chance
Doch wir kannen siegen
Fxr immer und ummer
Und wir sind dann Helden
Fxr einen Tag
Ich
Ich bin dann Kanig
Und du
Du Kanigin
Obwohl sie
Unschlagbar scheinen
Werden wir Helden
Fxr einen Tag
Wir sind dann wir
An diesem Tag
Ich
Ich glaubte zu tr`umen
Die Mauer
Im Rxcken war kalt
Schxsse reissen die Luft
Doch wir kxssen
Als ob nichts geschieht
Und die Scham fiel auf ihre Seite
O wir kannen sie schlagen
Fxr alle Zeiten
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Dann sind wir Helden
Nur diesen Tag
Dann sind wir Helden
We're nothing
And nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying
Then you better not stay
But we could be safer
Just for one dayListen day
Let me lie low
Lie low with you
To be alive
My oh my
Slowly
We get good and holy
Helping one another
Just a righteous brother
Night time
Gimme back the night time
I don't wanna be angel
Just a little bit evil
I feel a devil in me
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
An' let go of me
Listen lady
Let me lie low
Lie low with you
To be alive
My oh my
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
But just let me be
Holy holy
Hold on to anyone
Hold on to anyone
An' let go of meHe looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion.
Such a humble man
The only survivor
Of the national people's gang.
Panic in Detroit. I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home. I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit.
He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers
Were all that were left alive
Panic in Detroit. I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home. I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes I made my way to school
An' found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favourite slot machine
An' jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights.
Having scored a trillion dollars,
Made a run back home.
Found him slumped across the table.
A fun and me alone.
I ran to the window.
Looked for a plane or two.
Panic in Detroit. He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust". I wish someone would phone
Panic in DetroitSmiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted red
Rich men's children running past
Their fathers dressed in hose
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes
Gazing eyes and running wild
Past the stocks and over stiles
Kiss the window merry child
But come and buy my toys
You've watched your father plough the field with a ram's horn
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, threshed it with a quill
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys
Leave the parsley on the stalls
Come and buy my toys
You shall own a cambric shirt
You shall work your father's land 
But now you shall play in the market square
Till you'll be a man
Smiling girls and rosy boys
Come and buy my little toys
Monkeys made of gingerbread
And sugar horses painted redLet me introduce you to the gang
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist
Once he had a name, now he plays our game
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang
Molly is the model in the ads
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong 
Cause she can't switch off, now that she's joined the gang
Arthur is a singer with a band
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid
They want to see the croaking man who joined the band 
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins
It's a big illusion but at least you're in
At least you're in
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke 
This is how to spend now that you've joined a gang 
This is what to do now that you're here
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gangWar made him a soldier
Little Frankie Mear
Peace left him a loser
The little bombardier
Lines of worry appeared with age
Unskilled hands that knew no trade

Spent his time in the picture house
The little bombardier
Frankie drank his money
The little that he made
Told his woes to no man
Friendless, lonely days
Then one day, in the ABC
Four bright eyes gazed longinly
At the ice-cream in the hand of
The little bombardier
Sunshine entered our Frankie's days

Gone his worries, his hopeless maze
His life was fun and his life was full of joy
Two young children had changed his aims
He gave them toffees and played their games
He brought them presents with every coins he made
Then two gentlemen called him
Asked him for his name
Why was he friends with the children
Were they just a game
Leave them alone or we'll get sore
We've had blokes like you in the station before
The hand of authority said "no more" to 
The little bombardier
Packed his bags, his heart in pain
Wiped a tear, caught a train
Not to be seen in the town againJust look through your window, look who sits outside
Little me is waiting, standing through the night
When you'll walk through your door I'll wave my flag and shout

Oh, beautiful baby
My burning desire started on Sunday
Give me your heart and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum [x4]

Who's that hiding in the apple tree, clinging to a branch

Don't be afraid it's only me, hoping for a little romance

If you lie beneath my shade, I'll keep you nice and cool

Oh, beatiful baby
I was very lonely till I met you on Sunday
My passion's never-ending and I'll love you till Tuesday
Da da da dum [x7]
Let the wind blow through your hair, be nice to the big blue sea
Don't be afraid of the man in the moon, because it's only me

I shall always watch you until my love runs dry

Oh, beautiful baby
My heart's a flame, I'll love you till Tuesday
My head's in a whirl and I'll love you till Tuesday

Love, love, love, love you till Tuesday [x2]
Da da da dum [x11]

Well, I might stretch it till WednesdayThis girl is made of lipstick
Powder and paint
Sees the picture of herself
Every magazine on every shelf
This girl is maid of bond street
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs
This girl is a lonely girl
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus
Buys the Daily News
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her
This girl is made of loneliness
A broken heart
For the boy she once knew
Doesn't want to know her any more
And this girl is a lonely girl
Everything she wants is hers
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with
All the time, to love, all the time 
This boy is made of envy
Jealousy
He doesn't have a limousine
Really wants to be a star himself
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films 

Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor

And maids of bond street drive round in chauffered cars
Maids of Bond street picture clothes, eyes of star 
Maids of Bond street shouldn't have worldly cares

Maids of Bond street shouldn't have love affairsThere's a little churchyard just along the way
It used to be Lambeth's finest array
Of tombstones, epitaphs, wreaths, flowers all that jazz
Til the war come along and someone dropped a bomb on the lot

And in this little yard, there's a little old man
With a little shovel in his little bitty hand

He seems to spend all his days puffing fags and digging graves
He hates the reverend vicar and he lives all alone in his home
"Ah-choo, excuse me"
Please Mr. Gravedigger, don't feel ashamed
As you dig little holes for the dead and the maimed
Please Mr. Gravedigger, I couldn't care 
If you found a golden locket full of some girl's hair

And you put it in your pocket
"God, it's pouring down"
Her mother doesn't know about your sentimental joy
She thinks it's down below with the rest of her toys
And Ma wouldn't understand, so I won't tell
So keep your golden locket all safely hid away in your pocket
Yes, Mr. GD, you see me every day
Standing in the same spot by a certain grave
Mary-Ann was only 10 and full of life and oh so gay

And I was the wicked man who took her life away
Very selfish, oh God
No, Mr. GD, you won't tell
And just to make sure that you keep it to yourself
I've started digging holes myself
And this one here's for you
"Lifted our girl, she apparently doesn't know of it
Hello misses, thought she'd be a little girl
Bloody obscene, catch pneumonia or something in this rain"Rubber band
There's a rubber band that plays tunes out of tune
In the library garden Sunday afternoon
While a little chappie waves a golden wand

Rubber band
In 1910 I was so handsome and so strong
My moustache was stiffly waxed and one foot long

And I loved a girl while you played teatime tunes

Dear Rubber band, you're playing my tunes out of tune, oh

Rubber band, Won't you play a haunting theme again to me

While I eat my scones and drink my cup 
of tea

The sun is warm but it's a lonely afternoon
Oh, play that theme

Rubber band
How I wish that I could join your Rubber band
We could play in lively parks throughout the land
And one Sunday afternoon I'd find my love

Rubber band
In '14-'18 war I went to sea 
Thought my Sunday love was waiting home for me

And now she's married to the leader of the band, oh
[spoken]
Oh sob: I hope you break your batonLa la la la la la, la la la la la la la
A winter's day, a bitter snowflake on my face 
My summer girl takes little backward steps away 

Jack Frost took her hand and left me, Jack Frost ain't so cool

[CHORUS]
Sell me a coat with buttons of silver
Sell me a coat that's red or gold
Sell me a coat with little patch pockets
Sell me a coat 'cause I feel cold

And when she smiles, the ice forgets to melt away

Not like before, her smile was warming yesterday
See the trees like silver candy, feel my icy hand

[CHORUS]
See my eyes, my window pane
See my tears like gentle rain
That's a memory of the summer day

[CHORUS (twice)]
La la la la la la [repeat]She'd walk through the door and she'd set up the drinks 
on the house
She played a good game of darts, and the men slapped 
her back 
And never took her out
She wore a trenchcoat khaki
Her hobnail boots were full of holes
She's got medals
Her mother called her Mary, she changed her name to Tommy,
she's a one, oh 
She went and joined the army, passed the medical
Don't ask me how it's done
They sent her to the front line
Fighting for her country's name
She's got medals
She got very tired of picking up girls
Cleaning her gun and shaving her curls
Then the enemy dropped a bomb
Survivors there were none
People say that when the moon is full and all the stars have gone to bed
You can see her ghost but that's a lie because the naughty woman isn't dead
She deserted on the previous morning
Replaced her uniform with dresses silk and green
Called herself Eileen
Came to London town
Now she's settled down
She's got medalsMontains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not down
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die 
La la la la la la la la la la [x2]
La la la la la [x2]
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
Child of the Tibet, you're a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, silly boy blue
Silly boy blue, silly boy blueThere is a happy land where only children live
They don't have the time to learn the ways Of you sir, Mr. Grownup 
There's a special place in the rhubarb fields underneath the leaves
It's a secret place and adults aren't allowed there Mr. Grownup,
Go away sir
Charlie Brown got's half a crown, he's gonna buy a kite

Jimmy's ill with chicken pox, and Tommy's learned to ride his bike
Tiny Tim sings prayers and hymns, he's so small we don't notice him
He gets in the way but we always let him play with us

Mother calls, but we don't hear
There's lots more things to do 
It's only 5 o'clock, and we're not tired yet
But we will be, very shortly
Sissy Steven plays with girls, someone made him cry

Tony climbed a tree and fell, trying hard to touch the sky

Tommy lit a fire one day, nearly burned the field away

Tommy's mum found out, but he put the blame on me and Ray

There is a happy land where only children live
You've had your chance and now the doors are closed sir, Mr. Grownup 
Go away sir
Boo, de boo, de boo, de boo dupStrikes the bell for 5 o'clock, Uncle Arthur closes shop 
Screws the tops on all the bottles, turns the lights out, locks it up 
Climbs across his bike and he's away 
Cycles past the gasworks, past the river, down the high street 
Back to mother, it's another empty day 

[CHORUS]
Uncle Arthur likes his mommy 
Uncle Arthur still reads comics 
Uncle Arthur follows Batman 

Round and round the rumours fly, how he ran away from Mum 
On his 32nd birthday, told her that he'd found a chum Mother cried and raved and yelled and fussed 
Arthur left her no illusion, brought the girl round, save confusion 
Sally was the real thing, not just lust 

[CHORUS]
Uncle Arthur vanished quickly 
Uncle Arthur and his new bride 
Uncle Arthur follows Sally 
Round and round goes Arthur's head, hasn't eaten well for days
Little Sally may be lovely, but cooking leaves her in a maze 

Uncle Arthur packed his bags and fled 
Back to mother, all's forgiven, serving in the family shop 

He gets his pocket money, he's well fed 
Uncle Arthur past the gasworks 
Uncle Arthur past the river 
Uncle Arthur down the high street 
Uncle Arthur follows mother[spoken]
Here is the news
According the latest world population survey
The figures have reached danger point, my god
London 15 million 75 thousand
New York 80 million
Paris 15 million and 30
China 1000 million
Billington-Spa: lots

My studies include suffragy
I formed my own society
To study the power of fecundity
The world will overpopulate
Unless you claim infertility
So who will buy a drink for me, your Messiah 

[CHORUS]
We are not your friends 
We don't give a damn for what you're saying 
We're here to live our lives
I propose to give the pill
Free of charge to those that feel
That they are not infertible
The crops of few, the cattle gun
There's only one way to linger on
So who will buy a drink for me, your 
Messiah

[CHORUS]
[spoken]
Achtung, achtung, these are your orders
Anyone found guilty of consuming more than their 
allotted amount of air
Will be slaughtered and cremated
One only cubic foot of air is :
I have prepared a document, legalising mass abortion
We will turn a blind eye to infanticide 

[CHORUS]
You don't seem to hear me clear
Do I talk about your sphere
Let me explain my project dear
Show you how I'll save the world
Or let it die within the year
Why do you look that way at me, your messiah

[CHORUS]
We are hungry men
We don't give a damn for what you're saying
We're here to eat youWhen I live my dream, I'll take you with me
Riding on a golden horse
We'll live within my castle, with people there to serve you

Happy at the sound of your voice

Baby, I'll slay a dragon for you
Or banish wicked giants from the land
But you will find, that nothing in my dream can hurt you
We will only love each other as forever

When I live my dream
When I live my dream, I'll forgive the things you've told me 

And the empty man you left behind
It's a broken heart that dreams, it's a broken heart you left me 
Only love can live in my dream
I'll wish, and the thunder clouds will vanish 

Wish, and the storm will fade away
Wish again, and you will stand before me while the sky will paint an ouverture 
And trees will play the rhythm of my dream

When I live my dream, please be there to meet me

Let me be the one to understand
When I live my dream, I'll forget the hurt you gave 
Then we can live in our new land
Till the day my dream cascades around me
I'm content to let you pass me by
Till that day, you'll run to many other men
But let them know it's just for now
Tell them that I've got a dream
And tell them you're the starring role
Tell them I'm a dreaming kind of guy
And I'm going to make my dream
Tell them I will live my dream
Tell them they can laugh at me
But don't forget your date with me
When I live my dreamSomeday they won't let you, so now you must agree
The times they are a-telling, 
and the changing isn't free
You've read it in the tea leaves, and the tracks are on TV
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

They'll split your pretty cranium, and fill it full of air
And tell that you're eighty, but brother, you won't care
You'll be shooting up on anything, tomorrow's neverthere
Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

[CHORUS]
Come see, come see, remember me

We played out an all night movie role

You said it would last, but I guess we enrolled

In 1984 (who could ask for more)
1984 (who could ask for mor-or-or-or-ore)
(Mor-or-or-or-ore)

I'm looking for a vehicle, I'm looking for a ride
I'm looking for a party, I'm looking for a side

I'm looking for the treason that I knew in '65

Beware the savage jaw 
Of 1984

[CHORUS]

1984 [ad lib]Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses
Don't live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal

He'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
He'll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin, 
then we can really begin

Please saviour, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

[CHORUS]
Someone to claim us, someone to follow

Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo

Someone to fool us, someone like you 
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square

But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord, I'd take an overdose if you knew what's going down

[CHORUS (3 times)]

We want you Big BrotherI'll make you a deal, like any other candidate

We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a
street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars

I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumours and lies and stories they made up

Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces, Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
So you scream out of line
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there
Any time"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing

Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar like a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we've must be looking for a different kind

But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright

I guess we could cruise down one more time

With you by my side, it should be fine

We'll buy some drugs and watch a band

Then jump in the river holding handsAs they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party

With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Todd Browning's freak you was

Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will,
mannequins with kill appeal

[CHORUS]
(Will they come) I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come) Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come)
Well, she's come, been and gone.

Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase

The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go

Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake

Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sableized

[CHORUS]

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the Ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow

[CHORUS]

Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs [x2]
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs [ad lib]

Keep cool - Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Beware of the Diamond Dogs [repeat]And in the death
As the last few corpses lay rotting on the slimy
thoroughfare
The shutters lifted in inches in Temperance Building
High on Poacher's Hill
And red, mutant eyes gaze down on Hunger City
No more big wheels

Fleas the size of rats sucked on rats the size of cats
And ten thousand peoploids split into small tribes
Coverting the highest of the sterile skyscrapers
Like packs of dogs assaulting the glass fronts of Love-Me Avenue
Ripping and rewrapping mink and shiny silver fox, now legwarmers
Family badge of sapphire and cracked emerald
Any day now 
The Year of the Diamond Dogs

"This ain't Rock'n'Roll
This is Genocide"You've got your mother in a whirl 
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl

Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

[CHORUS]
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know
Hot tramp, I love you so!

Don't ya

[CHORUS]

You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know
I said, how could they know

So what you wanna know Calamity's child, 
Where'd you wanna go
What can I do for you Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know
Eh, eh, how could they knowYou always were the one that knew
They sold us for the likes of you
I always wanted new surroundings
A room to rent while the lizards lay crying in the heat
Trying to remember who to meet

I would take a foxy kind of stand
While tens of thousands found me in demand

[CHORUS]
When you rock 'n' roll with me
No one else I'd rather be
Nobody here can do it for me
I'm in tears again
When you rock 'n' roll with me

Gentle hearts are counted down
The queue is out of sight and out of sounds
Me, I'm out of breath, but not quite doubting 
I've found a door which lets me out!

[CHORUS (x3)]It's safe in the city, to love in a doorway
To wrangle some screens from the door
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger

Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says

[CHORUS]
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap
thing

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment

If his trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads, and hamburgers, and...

[CHORUS]If you want it, boys, get it here thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing

Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain
Do you think that your face looks the same
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted

It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got youSomething kind of hit me today
I looked at you and wondered if you saw things my way

People will hold us to blame
It hit me today, it hit me today

We're taking it hard all the time
Why don't we pass it by
Just reply, you've changed your mind
We're fighting with the eyes of the blind
Taking it hard, taking it hard

Yet now
We feel that we are papers, choking on you nightly
They tell me "Son, we want you, be elusive, but don't walk far"
For we're breaking in the new boys, deceive your next of kin
For you're dancing where the dogs decay, defecating ecstasy
You're just an ally of the leecher
Locator for the virgin King, but I love you in your fuck-me pumps
And your nimble dress that trails
Oh, dress yourself, my urchin one, for I hear them on the rails
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said
We are the dead

One thing kind of touched me today

I looked at you and counted all the times we had laid
Pressing our love through the night

Knowing it's right, knowing it's right

Now I'm hoping some one will care
Living on the breath of a hope to be shared

Trusting on the sons of our love
That someone will care, someone will care

But now
We're today's scrambled creatures, locked in tomorrow's double feature
Heaven's on the pillow, its silence competes with hell
It's a twenty-four hour service, guaranteed to make you tell

And the streets are full of press men
Bent on getting hung and buried
And the legendary curtains are drawn 'round Baby Bankrupt
Who sucks you while you're sleeping
It's the theater of financiers
Count them, fifty 'round a table
White and dressed to kill

Oh caress yourself, my juicy
For my hands have all but withered
Oh dress yourself my urchin one, for I hear them on the stairs
Because of all we've seen, because of all we've said

We are the dead
We are the dead
We are the deadMy, my, the time do fly 
When it's in another pair of hands
And a loser I will be
For I've never been 
a winner in my life
I got used to stressing pain
I used the sucker pills
to pity for the self
Oh, it's the animal in me
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf

Don't be so forlorn, 
it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand
And I'll walk you through the doors
Don't be so forlorn, 
it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm

Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

My, my, but time do fly
When it's in another pair of pants
And illusion I will be
For I've never been a sinner,
la di da

Don't be so forlorn,
it's just the payoff
It's the rain before the storm
Don't you let my letter get you down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you

Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, downHe swivels his head
Tears his eyes from the screen
As his past puts him back 
in Atlantic City
There's not even a demon
in Heaven or Hell
Is it all just human disguise
As I walk down the aisle

And I'm gone gone gone
Now I'm older than movies
Let me dance away
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall

And I'm gone
Like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone 
through a crack in the past
Like a dead man walking
Like a dead man walking

Two young men dancing under the lamplight
Shaking their sex and their bones
And the boys that we were
An alien nation in therapy
Sliding naked and new
Like a bad tempered child 
On a rain slicked street

And I'm gone gone gone
And I'm older than movies
Oh let me dance dance dance
Now I'm wiser than dreams
Let me fly fly fly
While I'm touching tomorrow
And I know who's there
When silhouettes fall
And I'm gone

And I'm gone, like I'm dancing on angels
And I'm gone, 
through the crack in the past

In the street a man shouts out loud
A wallet drops and money flies into the midday sun

Oh I get a little bit afraid
Sometimes

Earthlings on fire

As he hits the floor he sighs
"What a morning"

You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains"
The old woman said
So I drink in the shadows
Of an evening sky
See nothing at all

The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the orc's zone
Time to question the mountain
Why pigs can fly
It's nothing at all

Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You'll come to me in tears and rain
I'm your future, 
I'm tomorrow, I'm the endWhat have you been doing to yourself
It's the last thing you should do
Nobody laughs any more 
It's the worst thing you can do
Save the last dance for me
Catch the last bus with me
Give the last kiss to me
It's the safest thing to do

Yeah!
Yeah!5:15

We never talk anymore
Forever I will adore you

Thin on the ground

Forever I'm out here foreverPlease don't tear this world asunder
Please take back
this fear we're under
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop wanting you
I might just stop wanting you
Please make sure we get tomorrow
All this pain and all the sorrow
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop needing you
I might just stop needing you
Give my children sunny smile
Give them moon and cloudless sky
I demand a better future
Or I might just stop loving you,
loving you, loving you
When we talk, we talk to you
When we walk, we walk to you
From factory to field
How many tears must fall
Down there below
Nothing is moving

I got so lost on the shore
I wish I was taller 
Things really matter to me

But I put my face in tomorrow
I believe we're not alone 
I believe in Beatles
I believe my little soul has grown 
And I'm still so afraid

Yes, I'm still so afraid
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own
On my own 
What made my life so wonderful
What made me feel so bad
I used to wake up the ocean
I used to walk on clouds 
If I put faith in medication
If I can smile a crooked smile 
If I can talk on television 
If I can walk an empty mile
Then I won't feel afraid
No, I won't feel afraid
I won't be Be afraid 
Anymore

wishing on a cement floor
Just wishing that
i had just something you wore
I put it on when I go lonely
Will you take off your dress 
and send it to me

I miss your kissin' 
and i miss your head
And a letter in your writing
doesn't mean you're not dead

Just run outside in the desert heat
Make your dress all wet 
and send it to me
I miss your soup and I miss your bread
And a letter in your writing 
doesn't mean you're not dead
So spill your breakfast 
and drip your wine
Just wear that dress when you dine 

D-A-V-I-D

So, sitting here wishing
on a cement floor
Just wishing that i had just something you wore
Bloody your hands on a cactus tree
Wipe'em on your dress 
and send it to me
Sitting here wishing on a cement floor 
Just wishing that i had just something you woreSaid you took a big trip
They said you moved away
Happened oh, so quietly
They say

Shoulda took a picture
Something I could keep
Buy a little frame
Something cheap
For you

Everyone says hi

Said you sailed a big ship
Said you sailed away
Didn't know the right thing
To say

I'd love to get a letter
Like to know what's what
Hope the weather's good
And it's not too hot
For you

Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi

Everyone says
Don't stay in a sad place
Where they don't care how you are
Everyone says hi

If the money is lousy
You can always come home
We can do the old things
We can do all the bad things
If the food gets you leery
You can always phone
We could do all the good things
We could do it, we could do it,
we could do it
Don't stay in a bad place
Where they don't care how you are

Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
Everyone says hi
And the girl next door
And the guy upstairs
Everyone says hi
And your mum and dad
Everyone says hi
And your big fat dog
Everyone says hi

Hi hi hi hiI took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you 
I passed through the shadow of Jupiter
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun
And boy, I really felt blue

Two or three flying saucers 
Parked under the stars 
The winding stream
Moon shining down 
On some little town
And with each beam 
The same old dream

I took a trip 
on a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you
I pulled down my sun visor
Boy, I really felt blue 

You jumped into your Gemini
I jumped into mine 
We'll orbit the moon
For just one time
Tomorrow night 
Tomorrow night 
Will you hold hands 
With me in the moonlight

I took a trip
in a gemini spacecraft
And I thought about you 
I shot my spacegun
And I thought about you 
I took
I took a walk in space 
Boy, I really felt blue 

Well, I peeked through the crack
And I looked way back 
The stardust trail 
Leading back to you
What did I do 
What could I do 
Yes what did I do 

Well
I thought about you
I thought about you
Took a trip
on a gemini spacecraft
Thought about youWalking in the snowy street
Let me understand
Drifting down a silent park
Stumbling over land
Open up your heart to me
Show me who you are
And I would be your slave

Do you sleep in quietude
Do you walk in peace
Do you laugh out loud at me
No one else that is free
Open up your heart to me
Show me all you are
And I would be your slave

I don't sit around and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand

I bet you laugh out loud at me
A chance to strike me down
Give me peace of mind at last
Show me all you are
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave

I don't sit and wait
I don't give a damn
I don't see the point at all
No footprints in the sand
I would give you all my love
Nothing else is free
Open up your heart to me
And I would be your slave(I've been looking, I've been looking)
(I've been looking, I've been looking)
I've been looking
For a woman
To save my life
Not to beg or to borrow
A woman with a feeling
of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me
For such a long time now
For such a long time now
A woman with a feeling
Of loosing once or twice
Who knows how it could be
Be tomorrow

I've been waiting for you
And you've been coming to me

Drags his bones
to see the Yankees play 
Bones Boy talks and flickers gray
Oh, they slip away 

Once a time 
they nearly might have been
Bones and Oogie on a silver screen 
No one knew what they could do 
Except for me and you
They slip away 
They slip away

Some of us will always stay behind
Down in space it's always 1982 
The joke we always knew 
Oo-oo 
What'sa matter with you
C'mon, let's go
Slip away

Don't forget

SailingHere shall we live in this terrible town
Where the price for our minds
shall squeeze them tight like a fist 
And the walls shall have eyes 
And the doors shall have ears
But we'll dance in their dark
And they'll play with our lives 

Like a Slow Burn
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn
Turning us round and round and round Hark who are we 
So small in times such as these
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn 

Oh, these are the days
These are the strangest of all
These are the nights 
These are the darkest to fall
But who knows
Echoes in tenement halls
Who knows 
Though the years spare them all

Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on 
Like a Slow Burn 
Twirling us round and round 
and upside down
There's fear overhead 
There's fear overground 
Slow Burn 
Slow Burn
Like a Slow Burn 
Leading us on and on and on
Like a Slow Burn 
Turning us round and round and round And here are we
At the center of it all
Slow Burn
Slow Burn
Slow BurnNothing remains 
We could run 
when the rain slows
Look for the cars or signs of life 
Where the heat goes 
Look for the drifters
We should crawl under the bracken 
Look for the shafts of light on the road
Where the heat goes

Everything has changed 
For in truth, it's the beginning of nothing
And nothing has changed 
Everything has changed
For in truth, it's the beginning of an end
And nothing has changed
And everything has changed 

[first voice]
In your fear 
Of what we have become
Take to the fire
Now we must burn 
All that we are 
Rise together
Through these clouds 
As on wings

[2nd voice]
In your fear, seek only peace 
In you fear, seek only love 
In your fear, seek only peace
In you fear, seek only love 
In your fear, in your fear 
As on wings 
This is the trip 
And this is the business we take
This is our number 
All my trials, Lord
Will be remembered
Everything has changedI, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be Heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that

Though nothing, will keep us together
We could steal time, 
just for one day
We can be Heroes, for ever and ever
What d'you say

I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing,
nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, 
just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads
(over our heads)
And we kissed, 
as though nothing could fall
(nothing could fall)
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, 
just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, 
then you better not stay
But we could be safer, 
just for one day

Your lips cut a smile
on your face
Your scalding face
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage

Too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
Your fearful hands
Get me to a doctor's I've been told
Someone's back in town
the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence
And my honour's at stake

The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood 
and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, 
stalking, screaming

If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, 
nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
Kiss you in the rain
In the rain
Get me to the doctor

Get me off the streets 
(get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)

While the streets block off 
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(get some protection)
Get me on my feet 
(get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets

A couple of drinks on the house an' he said
"Tell you who you are 
if you nail me to my car"

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
This is the kiss off

Boy
Thanks for hesitating
You'll never know the real story
Just a couple of dreams 
You get up and sleep

You can buy god it's Monday
Slither down the greasy pipe
So far so good no one saw you
Hobble over any freeway
You will be like your dreams tonight

You get up and sleep

A fortune teller he said
"Nail me to my car

The wind blows on your check
The day laughs in your face
Guess you'll buy a gun
You'll buy it secondhand
You'll get up and sleep

Stand on platforms
blank looks and note books
Sit in back rows 
of city limits
Lay in bed coming
and going on easy terms
Sons of the silent age
Pace their rooms
like a cell's dimensions
Rise for a year or two 
then make war
Search through their one inch thoughts
Then decide it couldn't be done

Baby, I'll never let you go
All I see is all I know
Let's find another way down

Baby, baby, I'll never let you down

Let's take another way in

Sons of the silent age
Listen to tracks by Sam Therapy 
and King Dice
Sons of the silent age
Pick up in bars 
and cry only once
Sons of the silent age
Make love only once 
but dream and dream
They don't walk, 
they just glide in and out of life
They never die, 
they just go to sleep one day

Baby, baby, baby, fire away!The secret life of Arabia
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

I was running at the speed of life
Through morning's thoughts and fantasies
Then I saw your eyes
at the cross fades
Secret secrets never seen
Secret secrets ever green

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever green

The secret life of Arabia
You must see the movie 
the sand in my eyes
I walk through a desert song 
when the heroine dies

Arabia (secret secret)
Arabia (secret)
Arabia (secret secret)

The secret life of Arabia
Never here never seen
Secret life ever greenWas she never there
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time

All the flowers so
From the gallery
with the hymns of night
Singing "come to me"
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life

Just one living chance
When the mother sighs
When the father steps aside
At the wrong time

Was she never here
Was she ever
Was it air she breathed
At the wrong time
On the wrong day
All the lights are fading now
If I'm dreaming all my life
If I'm dreaming all my life away
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my [x3]
Dreaming my life
Dreaming my life, away (oh ho)

We are the dead dreams
We take the blame
Take us to the edge of time

We are the fabulous lovers
I'm a blind man and she's my eyes

Suspicious minds
You didn't feel us coming
In this lonely crowd, it's always time

We are the tabular lovers
We listen to the storm

[CHORUS]I forgot what my father said 
I forgot what he said
I forgot what my mother said
as we layed upon your bed

A city full of flowers
a city full of rain
I got seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die 

I forgot what my brother said
I forgot what he said
I don't regret anything at all
I remember how he wept 

On a bridge of violent people
I was small enough to cry
I got seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die

Hold my face before you 
still my trembling heart
Seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die

The Gods forgot they've made me
so I forgot them to
I listen to the shadows
I play among their graves

My heart is never broken
my patience never tried
I got seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to die
Seven days to live my life 
or seven ways to dieYour coat and hat are gone
I really can't look at your little empty shelf
A ragged teddy bear
It feels like we never had a chance
Don't look me in the eye

We lay in each others arms
But the room is just an empty space
I guess we lived it out
Something in the air
We smiled too fast 
then can't think of a thing to say

Lived with the best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you too long
Nothing left to say

Let's take what we can
I know you hold your head up high
We've raced for the last time
A place of no return

And there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
Something in the air
Something in my eye

Abracadoo - I lose you
We can't avoid the clash
The big mistake
Now we're gona pay and pay
The sentence of our lives
Can't believe I'm asking you to go

We used what we could
To get the things we want
But we lost each other on the way
I guess you know I never wanted 
anyone more than you

Lived all our best times
Left with the worst
I've danced with you to long
Say what you will

But there's something in the air
Raced for the last time
Well I know you hold your head up high
There's nothing we have to say
There's nothing in my eyes
But there's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too long
There's something I have to say
There's something in the air
Something in my eye
I've danced with you too longGot Oh my, naked eyes
I should have kept you
I should have tried
I should have been a wiser kind of guy
I miss you 

Give me wings
Give me space
Give me money for a change of face
These noisy rooms and passion pants
I loved you

Where's the morning in my life
Where's the sense in staying right
Who said time is on my side
I've got ears and eyes and nothing in my life 
But I survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

You alone across the floor 
You and me and nothing more
You're the great mistake I never made
I never lied to you, I hated when you lied
But I'll survive your naked eyes
I'll survive

Beatle boys, all snowy white
Razzle dazzle clubs every night
Wish I'd sent a Valentine
I love you

I'll survive
Naked eyes
I'll survive
I'll survive
My naked eyes
I'll surviveBlack eyed ravens
They spiral down
They tilt his head back
To the flame filled sunset
Rise their guns high
As the darken falls
These are the days, boys 

Shallow man
Shallow man 
Eats in the doorways 
With his head inclined
And he's always in decline
No one heals anymore
So he shrinks as they ride
Under vermillion sky

So it goes 
Just a searcher
Lonely soul 
The last of the dreamers

Shallow man
Shallow man
Speaks to the shadows
Moves his trembling hands
And he's always a little late
For the dawning of the day

So it goes 
Just a searcher
Lonely soul 
The last of the dreamers 

[CHORUS]What to do
What to say
What to wear on a sunny day
Who the phone
Who to fight
Who to dance with on a sunday night

I'm reaching the very edge you know
Reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
Reaching the very edge 

[CHORUS]
You're still breathing but you don't know why
Life's a bit and sometimes you die
You're still breathing but you just can't tell
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

I am a drug, I am a dragon
I am your best jazz you ever seen
I am the dragon, I am the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I find you out before you grow old
I find you out before you grow old

What is eternal What is damned
What is clay and what is sand
Who to diss Who to trust
Who to listen to Who to suss

I'm reaching the very edge you know
I'm reaching the very edge
I'm going to the other side this time
I'm reaching the very edge

[CHORUS]

I am the dragon, I am the drug
I am your best jazz you've ever heard
I am the dragon, I'm the sky
I am the blood at the corner of your eye
I found the secrets I found gold
I found you out before you grow old
I found you out before you grow old
The pretty things are going to hell
They wore it out but they wore it wellAll of my life I've tried so hard
Doing my best with what I had 
Nothing much happened all the same 

Something about me stood apart
A whisper of hope that seemed to fail 
Maybe I'm born right out of my time
Breaking my life in two 

[CHORUS]
Throw me tomorrow
Now that I've really got a chance 
Throw me tomorrow 
Everything's falling into place 
Throw me tomorrow 
Seeing my past to let it go 
Throw me tomorrow 
Only for you I don't regret 
That I was Thursday's child 

Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was
Monday Tuesday Wednesday born I was 
Thursday's child

Sometimes I cried my heart to sleep 
Shuffling days and lonesome nights
Sometimes my courage fell to my feet 

Lucky old sun is in my sky 
Nothing prepared me for your smile 
Lighting the darkness of my soul 
Innocence in your arms 

[CHORUS]Grown inside a plastic box
Micro thoughts and safety locks
Hearts become outdated clocks
Ticking in your mind 

[CHORUS]
What's really happening
what tore us apart
What's really happening
What's really happening
what tore us apart
What's really happening

Now it's time to close our eyes
Now it's time to say goodbye
Now it's time to face the lie
That we'd never cry

[CHORUS]

All the clouds are made of glass
And they're slowly sinking
Falling like the shattered past
Were we built to last

[CHORUS]Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up 
just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[CHORUS]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint 
and he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[CHORUS]I still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste 
was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the stranger)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't want to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the stranger)
Ch-ch-Changes
Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time

I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence and
So the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware 
of what they're going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the stranger)
Ch-ch-Changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the stranger)
Ch-ch-Changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change me
But you can't trace time

Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace
I'm going through

Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the stranger)
Ch-ch-Changes
Oh, look out you rock 'n rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
(Turn and face the stranger)
Ch-ch-Changes
Pretty soon you're gonna get
a little older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace timeThe tactful cactus by your window
Surveys the prairie of your room
The mobile spins to its collision
Clara puts her head between her paws
They've opened shops down West side
Will all the cacti find a home
But the key to the city
Is in the sun that pins 
the branches to the skyFill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your Mind
Only in your Mind-Forget your Mind
And you'll be free-yea'
The writing's on the wall
Free-yea'. And you can know it all
If you choose. Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are Free of thoughts unpure [sic]
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it Free.

Happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
Fear's just in your Head
Only in your Head
Fear is in your Head
Only in your Head
So Forget your Head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free-yea'. And you can know it all
If you choose. Just remember
Lovers never lose
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind
And makes it Free!!

Free-yea'. Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah [repeat][CHORUS (x2)]
Will you stay in our Lovers' Story
If you stay you won't be sorry
'Cause we believe in you
Soon you'll grow so take a chance
With a couple of Kooks
Hung up on romancing

We bought a lot of things 
to keep you warm and dry
And a funny old crib on which the paint won't dry
I bought you a pair of shoes
A trumpet you can blow
And a book of rules
On what to say to people 
when they pick on you
'Cause if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty Kookie too

[CHORUS]

And if you ever have to go to school
Remember how they messed up 
this old fool
Don't pick fights with the bullies 
or the cads
'Cause I'm not much cop at punching other people's Dads
And if the homework brings you down
Then we'll throw it on the fire
And take the car downtown

[CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)]It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks
through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it
ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on

[CHORUS]
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man!
Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars

It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse
has grown up a cow
Now the workers 
have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it
ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on

[CHORUS]
Dring-dring-dring......
[Mind the phone]=====================
Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me, no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden ones
Written in pain, written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned
What we were here for
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
Look at your children
See their faces in golden rays
Don't kid yourself they belong to you
They're the start of a coming race
The earth is a bitch
We've finished our news
Homo Sapiens have outgrown their use
All the strangers came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh You Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo SuperiorWake up you sleepy head 
Put on some clothes,
shake up your bed 
Put another log on the fire for me 
I've made some breakfast and coffee 
Look out my window and what do I see 
A crack in the sky 
and a hand reaching down to me 
All the nightmares came today 
And it looks as though they're

No room for me,
no fun for you

[CHORUS:]
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Oh You Pretty Things 
Don't you know you're driving your 
Mamas and Papas insane 
Let me make it plain
([second time:] Let me say it again)
You gotta make way

[CHORUS]I'm up on the eleventh floor
And I'm watching the cruisers below
My heart's in the basement
My weekend's
at an all time low
He's down on the street
And he's trying hard
to pull sister Flo

'Cause she's hoping to score
So I can't see her
letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

[CHORUS]
She's so swishy in her satin and tat
In her frock coat
and bipperty-bopperty hat
Oh God, I could do better than that

She's an old-time ambassador 
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it,
she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen,
and such are queens
That your laughter
is sucked in their brains
Now she's leading him on
And she'll lay him right down
But it could have been me
Yes, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
why didn't I say, no, no, no

[CHORUS]

So I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
Oh the cot is so cold
It don't feel like no bed at all
Yeah I lay down a while
And I look at my hotel wall
But he's down on the street
So I throw both his bags down the hall
And I'm phoning a cab
'Cause my stomach feels small
There's a taste in my mouth
And it's no taste at all

It could have been me
Oh yeah, it could have been me
Why didn't I say,
Why didn't I say, no, no, no

[CHORUS]I'm closer to the Golden Dawn 
Immersed in Crowley's uniform 
Of imagery 
I'm living in a silent film 
Portraying 
Himmler's sacred realm 
Of dream reality 
I'm frightened by the total goal 
Drawing to the ragged hole 
And I ain't got the power anymore 
No I ain't got the power anymore 

I'm the twisted name 
on Garbo's eyes 
Living proof of 
Churchill's lies 
I'm destiny 
I'm torn between the light and dark 
Where others see their targets 
Divine symmetry 
Should I kiss the viper's fang 
Or herald loud
the death of Man 
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore

[CHORUS]
Don't believe in yourself 
Don't deceive with belief 
Knowledge comes
with death's release 

I'm not a prophet 
or a stone age man 
Just a mortal 
with the potential of a superman 
I'm living on 
I'm tethered to the logic 
of Homo Sapien 
Can't take my eyes 
from the great salvation 
Of bullshit faith 
If I don't explain what you ought to know 
You can tell me all about it 
On, the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand 
of my thought 
And I ain't got the power anymore

[CHORUS]Oh, hear this Robert Zimmerman
I wrote a song for you
About a strange young man 
called Dylan
With a voice like sand and glue
His words of truthful vengeance
They could pin us to the floor
Brought a few more people on
And put the fear in a whole lot more

Ah, Here she comes
Here she comes
Here she comes again
The same old painted lady
From the brow of a superbrain
She'll scratch this world to pieces
As she comes on like a friend
But a couple of songs
From your old scrapbook
Could send her home again

You gave your heart to every bedsit room
At least a picture on my wall
And you sat behind a million pair of eyes
And told them how they saw
Then we lost your train of thought
The paintings are all your own
While troubles are rising
We'd rather be scared
Together than alone

Ah, Here she comes...[etc.]

Now hear this Robert Zimmerman
Though I don't suppose we'll meet
Ask your good friend Dylan
If he'd gaze a while
down the old street
Tell him we've lost his poems
So they're writing on the walls
Give us back our unity
Give us back our family
You're every nation's refugee
Don't leave us with their sanity

Ah, Here she comes....[etc.]And so the story goes 
they wore the clothes
They said the things
to make it seem improbable
The whale of a lie
like they hope it was
And the Goodmen of Tomorrow
Had their feet in the wallow
And their heads of Brawn
were nicer shorn
And how they bought their positions with saccharin and trust
And the world was asleep
to our latent fuss
Sighing, the swirl through the streets
Like the crust of the sun
The Bewlay Brothers
In our Wings that Bark
Flashing teeth of Brass
Standing tall in the dark
Oh, And we were Gone
Hanging out with your Dwarf Men
We were so turned on
By your lack of conclusions

I was Stone and he was Wax
So he could scream,
and still relax, unbelievable
And we frightened the small children away
And our talk was old
and dust would flow
Thru our veins and Lo!
it was midnight
Back o' the kitchen door
Like the grim face
on the Cathedral floor
And the solid book we wrote
Cannot be found today

And it was Stalking time
for the Moonboys
The Bewlay Brothers
With our backs on the arch
In the Devil-may-be-here
But He can't sing about that
Oh, And we were Gone
Real Cool Traders
We were so Turned On
You thought we were Fakers

Now the dress is hung,
the ticket pawned
The Factor Max that proved the fact
Is melted down
And woven on the edging of my pillow
Now my Brother lays upon the Rocks
He could be dead, He could be not
He could be You
He's Camelian, Comedian, Corinthian and Caricature
"Shooting-up Pie-in-the-Sky"
The Bewlay Brothers
In the feeble and the Bad
The Bewlay Brothers
In the Blessed and Cold
In the Crutch-hungry Dark
Was where we flayed our Mark
Oh, and we were Gone
Kings of Oblivion
We were so Turned On
In the Mind-Warp Pavilion

Lay me place and bake me Pie
I'm starving for me Gravy
Leave my shoes, and door unlocked
I might just slip away
Just for the Day, Hey!
Please come Away, Hey! [repeat ad inf.]See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Colder than the moon
It's been so long
And I've been putting out fire 
With gasoline

Feel my blood enraged
It's just the fear of losing you
Don't you know my name
Well, you been so long

See these eyes so red
Red like jungle burning bright
Those who feel me near
Pull the blinds and change their minds
It's been so long

Still this pulsing night
A plague I call a heartbeat
Just be still with me
Ya wouldn't believe what I've been thru
You've been so long
Well it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire 
with gasoline
putting out fire
with gasoline

See these tears so blue
An ageless heart 
that can never mend
These tears can never dry
A judgement made
can never bend
See these eyes so green
I can stare for a thousand years
Just be still with me
You wouldn't believe what I've been thru

You've been so long
Well, it's been so long
And I've been putting out fire
with gasoline
putting out fire with gasolineI could escape this feeling 
with my China girl
I feel a wreck 
without my little China girl
I hear her heart beating
loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing 

I'm a mess
without my little China girl 
Wake up mornings where's my little China girl
I hear her heart's beating 
loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down

I feel a-tragic 
like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my china girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China girl

I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swasticas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes

My little China girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you man who wants to rule the world

And when I get excited
My little China girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says : sh-sh-shhhYou never told me of your other faces
You were the widow of a wild cat
And now I know about your special kisses
And I know you know where that's at
I guess I recognize your destination
I think I see beneath your make-up
What you want is sort of separation
This is no ordinary
This is no ordinary
(ah, ah, ah)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal worl
Where the girls are like baby-faced boys

You've got a very heavy reputation
But no one knows about your low-life
I know a way
to find a situation 
And hold a candle 
to your high life disguise
You caught me kneeling 
at your sister's door
That was no ordinary stick-up
I'm well aware just 
what you're looking for
I am no ordinary
I am no ordinary
(ah, ah, ah)
What a criminal world
The boys are like baby-faced girls
What a criminal girl
She'll show you where to shoot your gun
What a typical mother's son
The only thing that she enjoys
Is a criminal world
Where the girls are like baby-faced boysLet's dance put on your red shoes and dance the blues

Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway 
while color lights up your face
Let's sway 
sway through the crowd to an empty space

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance for fear 
your grace should fall
Let's dance for fear tonight is all

Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlight

If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance put on your red shoes 
and dance the blues

Let's dance to the song 
they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway you could look into my eyes
Let's sway under the moonlight, 
this serious moonlightI know when to go out 
And when to stay in 
Get things done [spoken]

I catch a paper boy
But things don't really change
I'm standing in the wind
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

There's no sign of life
It's just the power to charm
I'm lying in the rain
But I never wave bye-bye

But I try
I try

Never gonna fall for
Modern Love walks beside me
Modern Love walks on by
Modern Love gets me to the Church on Time
Church on Time terrifies me 
Church on Time makes me party
Church on Time puts my trust in God and Man 
God and Man no confessions
God and Man no religion
God and Man don't believe
in Modern LoveLike weeds on a rockface waiting for the scythe
Ricochet - Ricochet
The world is on a corner waiting for jobs
Ricochet - Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures 
so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Men wait for news while thousands are still asleep

Dreaming of tramlines, factories, pieces of machinery
Mine shafts, things like that
March of flowers - March of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet - It's not the end of the world
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil 
breaking parole
Ricochet - Ricochet
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Teaching life in a violent new way
Ricochet - Ricochet
Turn the holy pictures so they face the wall
And who can bear to be forgotten
And who can bear to be forgotten
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Early, before the sun,
they struggle off to the gates
In their secret fearful places 
they see their lives
Unravelling before them
March of flowers, march of dimes
These are the prisons, these are the crimes
Sound of thunder, sound of gold
Sound of the devil
breaking parole
Ricochet 
it's not the end of the world

But when they get home, 
damp eyed and weary
They smile and crush their children to their heaving chests
Making unfulfillable promises
For who can bear to be forgottenI feel like a sail-boat
Adrift on the sea
It's a brand new day
So when you gonna phone me

I could take you to heaven
I could spin you to hell
But I'll take you to New York
It's the place that I know well

Sitting on a flagstone talking to a faceless girl
Wondering what to say but my eyes do the talking so well

I duck and I sway - What's my line
Shoot at a full moon - What's my line
What's my line - Shake it baby

Cause love is the answer
Love's talking to me
I'd scream and I'll fight for you
You're better than money

We're the kind of people 
who can shake it 
if we're feeling blue
When I'm feeling disconnected well I sure know what to do
Shake it babyJust when I'm ready to throw in my hand
Just when the best things in life 
are gone
I look into my eyes

There's no smoke without fire
You're exactly who I want to be with
Without you
What could I do

And when I'm willing to call it a day
Just when I won't take another chance
I hold your hand

There's no smoke without fire
Woman I love you
Without you
What would I doAfrican nightmare one-time Mormon
More men fall in Hullabaloo men
I slide to the nearest bar
Undermine chairman 
I went too far
Bent on a windfall 
rent a sony

Wonder 
how the dollar went down
Gotta get a word to Elizabeth's father
Hey no, he wished me well

Seemed like another day
I could fly 
into the eye of god on high

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days

Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabana

Getting in mood for a Mombassa night flight
Pushing my luck, gonna fly like a mad thing
Bare strip takeoff
skimming over Rhino

Born in slumber less than peace
Struggle with a child 
whose screaming dreaming
Drowned by the props all steely sunshine

Sick of you, sick of me
Lust for the free life
Quashed and maimed
Like a valuable loved one
Left unnamed

Seemed like another day
I could fly 
into the eye of god on high

Over the bushland over the trees
Wise like Orangutan that was me

His burning eye will see me through
One of these days, one of these days
Gotta get a word through one of these days

Asanti habari habari habari
Asanti nabana nabana nabanaHeaven loves ya

Nothing stands in your way
When you're a boy

Clothes always fit ya
Life is a pop of the cherry
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can wear a uniform
When you're a boy
Other boys check you out
You get a girl
These are your favourite things
When you're a boy

Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it out

Uncage the colours
Unfurl the flag
Luck just kissed you hello
When you're a boy

They'll never clone ya
You're always first on the line
When you're a boy

When you're a boy
You can buy a home of your own
When you're a boy
Learn to drive and everything
You'll get your share
When you're a boy

Boys
Boys
Boys keep swinging
Boys always work it outI'm home, lost my job, 
and incurably ill
You think this is easy realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around

I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

One more weekend of lights 
and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around,
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me

I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)

Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers

I've got believers 
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.In the event
that this fantastic voyage
Should turn to erosion 
and we never get old
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by, I suppose
It's a very modern world,
but nobody's perfect

It's a moving world, 
but that's no reason
To shoot some of those missiles
Think of us as fatherless scum
It won't be forgotten
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we

And the wrong words make you listen
In this criminal world
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable
But our lives are valuable too

We're learning to live with somebody's depression
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression
We'll get by I suppose
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down
And it won't be forgotten
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
see it in my eyes
Till you come

No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me

(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, 
feel it in my voice
Till you come

(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) 
[repeat ad inf.]Sometimes I feel
That I need to move on
So I pack a bag
And move on
Move on

Well I might take a train
Or sail at dawn
Might take a girl
When I move on
When I move on

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I'm just a travelling man
Maybe it's just a trick of the mind, but
Somewhere there's a morning sky
Bluer than her eyes
Somewhere there's an ocean
Innocent and wild

Africa is sleepy people
Russia has its horsemen
Spent some nights in old Kyoto
Sleeping on the matted ground
Cyprus is my island
When the going's rough
I would love to find you
Somewhere in a place like that

Somewhere, someone's calling me
When the chips are down
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Feeling like a shadow
Drifting like a leaf
I stumble like a blind man
Can't forget you
Can't forget you

Can't forget you
Can't forget youOh, can you feel it in the way
That a man is not a man
Can you see it in the sky
That the landscape is too high

Like a nervous disease
And it's been there all along
It will tumble from the sky
It's been there all along

OooooooJohnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through when you ask him how the kids are

He'll get home around seven
'Cause the chevy's real old
And he could have had a cadillac
If the school had taught him right
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
(Don't hit her)

"Can't you even cook
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook"

Well Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show 
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

Shows through

Yassassin - I'm not a moody guy
Yassassin - I walk without a sound
Yassassin - 
Just a working man, no judge of men
Yassassin - 
But such a life I've never known

We came from the farmlands
To live in this city
We walked proud and lustful
In this resonant world
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

Look at this - no second glances
Look at this - no value of love
Look at this - just sun and steel
Look at this - then look at us

If there's someone in charge
Then listen to me
Don't say nothing's wrong
'Cause I've got a love 
And she's afeared
You want to fight
But I don't want to leave
Or drift away

As I pushed my foot down to the floor
I was going round and round the hotel garage
Must have been touching close to 94

Don't look at the carpet,

You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch youDon't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision

Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue

I will sit right down, 
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude,
over my head

Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all

She was born in a handbag
Love left
on a doorstep
What she lacks is a backup
Nothing seems to make a dent
Gonna find her some money honey
Try to pay her rent
That's the kind of protection everyone is shouting about

she's a citizen
Some things they turn out right
When you're under the USA
Something rings a bell 
and it's all over
She's going out her way
Stealing for that one good rush

Day-In Day-Out

She could use a little money
She's hangin' on his arms
like a cheap suit
She's got no money, honey

She's gonna take a train ride
Nobody knows her, or knows her name 

She's in the pocket of a home boy
Oo she's gonna take her a shotgun Pow

She's gonna make them well aware
She's an angry gal

Suddenly there's angels everywhere
Angels in a ton of sound
And they shootin' her down
Shootin her with video-drugs-bullets and promisesUp until one century ago there lived,
In the Zi Duang province of eastern country
A glass-like spider
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons 
over its web
In weeks creating a macabre
Shrine of remains
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers
Like floors in a building

At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with 
almost apparent
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops
One could almost call it an altar
When the breeze blew 
thru this construction
It produced sounds of wailing, crying
Tiny wails, tiny cries

The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically for their mother.
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies
Would survive somehow
on their own.
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.

Don't you hear this wasted cry, 
Life is over you
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)
Take care, take care.
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)

Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.
But you, you've promise 
in your lovin' eye. 

God it's dark now.

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone, Gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all gone
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you,
savage and afraid
Spitting the dawn, come come come along
before the animals awake
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might 
Gone, gone, the water's all gone
Mummy come back
'cause the water's all gone

Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah

Gone gone the water's all gone
Mummy come back 
'cause the water's all goneWhen I believed in nothing 
I called her name
Trapped in a high-dollar joint 
in some place 
I called her name
And though my days are slipping by
And nights so cruel 
I thought I'd die
She danced her little dance 
'till it made me cry
She was shakin' like this honey doing that

When I needed soul revival 
I called your name
When I was falling to pieces 
I screamed in pain

Your soothing hand that turned me round
A love so real 
swept over me
You danced your little dance 
'till it made me cry
You were shakin' like this honey doing that

Never let me down She never let me down
Never let me down She never let me down

When all your faith is failing Call my name
When you've got nothing coming Call my name

I'll be strong for all it takes
I'll cover your head
till the bad stuff breaks
I'll dance my little dance 
till it makes you smile
Shaking like this honey doing that

Never let you down I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you downDo you see that thing
I'm sure it's love
Would you do one thing
New York's in love
The city grew wings 
in the back of the night
The clouds are stuck
like candy-floss
She sees the rich trash 
having all the fun
Makes her wonder where they get the energy from

There's nothing you can do to her
This city's all clean and waiting
I don't mean to wait too long
But this joint can't get much higher

[CHORUS]
New York's in love-
With her big green eyes
And her long blonde hair
New York's in flames
New York's in love
With the way she talks
And the way she walks
New York's in love
Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo Goo

My, oh my, it's a tom-tom beat
No-one knows they've had their day
We can dance and we can see the singles swing
Everybody's waiting for the Go-Go Boys.
You're turned to stone by the family
It's now the dead speak to the living
Nothing left here 
but a raging blaze
I don't mean to wait too long

[CHORUS]Eddie boy lit like paraffin 
spending two weeks
in a crack house
Burns on his brain 
like Chernobyl

Dean was seen 
with a two bag purchase
He was lying dead on his mother's bed
Someone for pray for-
till I met you

Life is like a broken arrow-
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
I can make you happy
every day of your life
Making my love 
like a shining star
takin' my love just a touch too far

Tessie turns tricks with a soul like ice 
cause love left holes
And four swell kids breaking her heart
I've got windows, I've seen much vice, 
I've touched down with vermin,
Cowardice, lice,
And I say

Nobody cares what you do-
please be yourself to death

I could be your great misfortune
But you'll never find a, bet you'll never find a better man.

Making my love 
like a shining star
Taking my love just a touch too far.

Peter met Frank 
formed a dummy run gang
Worked heist or hit for 10 g's flat
Blew heads outta shape for the name of Trotsky, Sinn-
Fein, Hitler cashdown
No hope heroes cover the page 
with debts in hell
And fingers in blood
Poor little bodies all covered in scabs 
threw it all away
Another life in the grave
Another life in the grave

Life is like a broken arrow-
memory a swingin' door
I could be your great misfortune-
Well I could make you happy 
every goddamn single day of your life

Making my love
like a shining star
Like a shining star
Baby that's what you are
Like a shining star

Making my love
like a shining star
Taking my love
Just a touch too farI've never sailed on a sea
I would not challenge a giant
I could not take on the church
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

I know a government man
He was as blind as the moon
He saw the sun in the night
He took a top-gun pilot and he
He made him fly thru a hole
Till he grew real old
And he never came down
He just flew till he burst

Time will crawl 
Till our mouths 
run dry
Time will crawl 
Till our feet
grow small
Time will crawl 
Till our tails
fall off
Time will crawl
till the 21st century lose

I saw a black black stream
Full of white eyed fish
And a drowning man
With no eyes at all
I felt a warm warm breeze
That melted metal and steel
I got a bad migraine
That lasted three long years
And the pills that I took
Made my fingers disappear

Time will crawl, time will crawl
Time will crawl
Till the 21st century lose

You were a talented child
You came to live in our town
We never bothered to scream
When your mask came off
We only smelt the gas
As we lay down to sleep

Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl 
and our mouths run dry
Time will crawl 
and our feet grow small
Time will crawl 
and our tails fall off
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

Time will crawl 
and our heads bowed down
Time will crawl 
and our eyes fall out
Time will crawl 
and the streets run red
Time will crawl 
till the 21st century lose

For the crazy child
We'll give every life
For the crackpot notionThere's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
I'm trying not to lose control
But you're just pushin' for a fight
You look trapped, turn the radio on
Too much smoke, air conditioning gone
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking , looking for a break

[CHORUS]
Is it love or is it what
Who's this guy I'm gonna blow away
What kind of love is he giving you
I'm-a-dizzy's 
what I'm trying to say
Too Dizzy-
You can't have a lover
Too Dizzy-
It's me and no other
I'm a bad loser-I'm-a-shakin' in anger
Too Dizzy-you can't have no lover

[2nd time:] Don't come any harder
Don't come any closer

You can go on dreaming every night
But I'm not letting you out of my sight
I'm-a-ten times the man than any guy around
But you're just itchin'-twitchin'-itchin' for a break

There's too much talking for a night drive
Too much mist in front of my eyes
But I'm helpless in love with you
But you're just looking for a break

Tonight, yes, the Zeroes will be singing for you!)

And the fabulous sons have crashed their planes in flames
Now tomorrow's back claiming redemption is on your heels
And a toothless past is asking you
how it feels

My rainy day girl 
is feeling down

And she tells me 
that the world is spinning round
I say the dream was all for you

Gotta get forgive and forget hey-hey

Don't you know we're back on trial again today

And it's breaking wine for you
Hell it's only 'cause you're true

Stopping and preaching 
and letting love in
You are my moon, you are my sun
Heaven knows what you are
Tonight the Zeroes are singing for you
Yes they were

He never knew what hit him
And it hit him so
Poor dunce
He pushed back the pigmen
The Barbs laughed
The fool is dead

Poor dunce
He's less than within us
The brains talk
But the will to live is dead
And prayer can't travel 
so far

The talk of your life
Standing so near
To innocent eyes

Swings thru the tunnels
And claws his way
Is small life so manic
Are these really the days

Of Touchshriek with mail over and fantasy
My shop sells egg shells off the shesores and

I'm thinking of leasing the room above my shop 
To a Mr. Walloff Domburg
A reject from the world wide Internet 

He's a broken man 
I'm also a broken man

It would be nice to have company
We could have great conversations 
Looking through windows for demons
And watching the young advance in all electric

Some of the houses around here 
still have inhabitants in them
I'm not sure if they're from this country or not
I don't get to speak much to anyone 
or that sort of thing
If I had another broken name
Oh, I dream of something like thatTest, testing, testing

And and I was...um...
It was that phot... a fading photograph of a patch..., a patchwork quilt. 
And they've put me on these...
Ramona put me on 
these interest drugs 

So I'm thinking very too bit too fast like a brain hatch

And ah they won't let me see anybody
If I want to sometimes ... and I ask
I can still hear some pop...popular musics and aftershocks. (Ahhh-choo)
See I've been watching a television of um... 
in the homelands
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember
And now they just want me to be quiet
And I think something is going to be horrid(Hallo) Spaceboy,

She was if you don't mind me saying so an update demon
Now Leon
He couldn't wait for 12 o'clock midnight
He jumps up on the stage
With a criss criss machete
And slashes around cutting a zero on everything
I mean a zero 
in the fabric of time itself 
Was this a suspect
I says to myself
Woa! "Quelle courage!"
Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself
Let me take you back to 
when it all beganStay away from the future
Back away from the light
It's all deranged - no control
Sit tight in your corner
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

If I could control tomorrow's haze
The darkened shore wouldn't bother me
If I can't control 
the web we weave
My life will be lost in the fallen leaves

Every single move's uncertain
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man

No control
Stay away from the future
Don't tell God your plans
It's all deranged
No control

Forbidden words, deafen me
In memory, no control
See how far a sinful man
Burns his tracks, his bloody robes

You've gotta have a scheme
You've gotta have a plan
In the world of today, for tomorrow's man
I should live my life on bended knee
If I can't control my destiny
No control I can't believe
I've no control
It's all deranged

I can't believe I've no control
It's all deranged
Deranged
DerangedNow. Not tomorrow.
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

It happens today
The damage today
They fall on today
They beat on the outside
And I'll stand by you

Now. Not tomorrow
It's happening now
Not tomorrow

It's happening now
The crazed in the hot-zone
The mental and diva's hands
The fisting of life
To the music outside
To the music outside

It happens outside
The music is outside
It's happening outside
The music is outside
It's happening now
Not tomorrow
Yesterday
Not tomorrow

The music is outside
It's happening outside

Ramona A. Stone
I started with no enemies of my own
I was an artiste
In a tunnel
But I've been having a mid-life crisis
And I've been dreaming in a sleep
And ape men with metal parts
I've spat upon deeply felt age
I've hid my hearts in
And I hate the funny colored english
We'll creep together you and I
For I know who the small friends are

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
A night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name, I am with name 

I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say: twitch & stream
It'll end in chrome
Night of the female 
good time drone
I am with name 
I am Ramona A Stone
She should say: 
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone

A person who loses a name
Feels anxiety descending
Left at the crossroads, between the centuries
A millenium fetish
I am with name, I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone
I am with name

Night fear female
Good timing drone
I am with name
I am Ramona A Stone 
I am Ramona A Stone

(Give it to me one more time!) 7
Anxiety descending
Anxiety descendingAll my friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy prayers
No trendy rechauffe 
I'm with you
So I can't go on

[CHORUS]
All my violence
Raining tears upon the sheet
I'm bewildered/resentful
For we're strangers when we meet

Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

[CHORUS]
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
Was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

Steely resolve
Is falling from me
My poor soul
All bruised passivity
All your regrets
Ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful
That we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover
For we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over
And we're strangers when we meet(Heart's filthy lesson) 
There's always the Diamond friendly
Sitting in the Laugh Motel
The Heart's filthy lesson
With her hundred miles to hell

Oh, Ramona - if there was only something between us
If there was only something between us
Other than our clothes
Something in our skies
Something in our skies
Something in our blood
Something in our skies
Paddy, Paddy
Who's been wearing Miranda's clothes

It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Heart's filthy lesson
Falls upon deaf ears
Falls upon dead ears

(Heart's filthy lesson)
Oh Ramona, if there was only some kind of future [x2]
And these cerulean skies
Something in our skies [x2]
Something in our blood
Something in our skies

Paddy, Paddy
Paddy oh Paddy, 
I think I've lost my way
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson)
I'm already five years older I'm already in my grave
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson)
I'm already (x3)
(Heart's filthy lesson, Heart's filthy lesson)
Will you carry me
Oh Paddy, I think I've lost my way
Paddy, what a fantastic death abyss (2)
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson

Tell the others
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy,
What a fantastic death abyss
Tell the others
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Paddy, 
what a fantasic death abyss
(Heart's filthy lesson)
It's the Heart's filthy lesson
Tell the othersFor we're living
in a safety zone
Don't be holding back from me
We're living from hour to hour down here
And we'll take it when we can
It's a kind of living which recognises
The death of the odourless man
When nothing is vanity nothing's too slow
It's not Eden but it's no sham

There is no hell
There is no shame
There is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell
And it's lights up, boys
Lights up boys

Explosion falls upon deaf ears
While we're swimming in a sea of sham
Living in the shadow of vanity
A complex fashion for a simple man

And there is no hell
And there is no shame
And there is no hell
Like an old hell
There is no hell

And the silence flies
on its brief flight
A razor sharp crap shoot affair
And we light up our lives
And there's no more of me exploding you
Re-exposing you
Like everybody do
Re-exploding you
I don't know what to use
Make somebody move
Me exploding
Me exploding youI shake
And stare at the sun
Till my eyes burn
I shake
At the mothers brutal vermin
I shake
And stare at the watery moon
With the same desire
As the sober Philistine
And I shake
(Turn and turn again)
Worm, the pain and blade
Turn and turn again

The screw
Is a tightening Atrocity
I shake
For the reeking flesh
Is as romantic as hell
The need
To have seen it all
The Voyeur of Utter Destruction
As beauty
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake
Turn and turn again
I shake [x3]

Research has pierced
All extremes of my sex
Call it a day
Call it a day
Needle point life
Blinds the will to be next
Call it a day [repeat]
Today [repeat ad. inf]Stomping along 
on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
Looking across at Richard Rogers
Scheming dreams to blow both their minds
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
To leave a job
When you know 
You know the money's from day to day

[CHORUS]
All the majesty of a city landscape
All the soaring days in our lives
All the concrete dreams 
in my mind's eye
All the joy I see 
Thru these architect's eyes

Cold winter bleeds 
on the girders of Babel
This stone boy watching the crawling land
Rings of flesh and the towers of iron
The steaming caves and the rocks and the sand
Stomping along on this big Phillip Johnson
Is delay just wasting my time
It's difficult you see
To give up baby
These summer scumholes
This goddamned starving life

[CHORUS]

It's difficult you see
It's difficult you seeWhite boys falling on the fires of night
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
Flesh punks burning 
in their glue
Revolution comes in the strangest way
(I wish you'd tell, I wish you'd tell)
I'd rather be inside you

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]
Tell the truth [x3]
We prick you we prick you we prick you
(You show respect even if you disagree
You show respect)

Mama can I kiss you daddy can I ***you
(we wish you well, we wish you well)
Innocence passed me by
Wanna be screwing 
when the nightmare comes
(I wish you well, I wish you well)
Wanna come quick and die

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]

All the little rose-kissed foxy girls
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Where have all the flowers gone
All the little fragile champion boys
Toys, toys, little black toys
Dripping on the end of a gun 
(Even if you disagree)

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
(even if you disagree, even if you disagree)
Toys, toys, little black toys
Wish you well, wish you well
Shoes, shoes, little white shoes
Wish you well, wish you wellCruising around me 
the flames burn my body
Wishful beginnings
Does this remind them again & again
You're a sorry little girl
You're a sorry little girl
Please hide, 
for the pain must feel 
like snow
You're a sorry little girl
Sorry little girl

Please hide from the kiss and the bite
Shame burns
Breathing in, breathing out
Breathing in only doubt
The pain must feel like snow
I'm no longer your golden boy
Sorry little girl
I'm sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go
Cover me, cover me
We flew on the wings
We were deep in the dead air
And this one will never go down

We had such
wishful beginnings
But we lived 
unbearable lives
I'm sorry little girl
Sorry little girl
So so sorry little girl

The pain must feel like snow
There you go
There you go[CHORUS]

I get along anyway I care
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere

[CHORUS]

Anyway, anyway I choose
I wanna go
Do it myself, do it myself, 
Anyway, anyway I chooseI'm on my own, nowhere to roam
I tell you baby, don't want no home
I wander round, feet off the ground
I even go from town to town
I said I think 
this rock is grand
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I met this chick, the other day
And then to me, she said she'll stay
I get this pad, just like a cave
And then we'll have, our living made
And then I'll lead her on the ground
My head is spinning round
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down

I, I, I, I, I need a lover 
'cause someone new

And then to her I will be true
I'll buy her furs and pretty things
I'll even buy a wedding ring
But until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Until then I'll settle down
Say I'll be your man
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down
Don't bring me downOh, little baby

(Tonight) I spend my bread
(Tonight) I lose my head
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight
Monday I have Friday on my mind

Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)

There is nothing else that bugs me
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar 
man, thief)
Hey I'll change that scene one day
Today I might be mad
Tomorrow I'll be glad
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind

[CHORUS]

(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)
Gonna have fun
(zoom zoom zoom)
Be with my girl [repeat ad lib.]Ohhhhh... here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Oh, yeah (here comes the night)

I can see right out my window walking down the street my girl
With another guy
His arms around her 
like it used to be with me
Oh it makes me want to die

[CHORUS]
Yeah, here it comes
Here comes the night
Yeah, here comes the night
Yeah... (here comes the night)

There they go, funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me
Why can't I accept 
the fact she's chosen him 
And simply let them be

[CHORUS]

Oh she's with him 
they're turning down the lights
Now he's holding her the way I used to do
I can see her closing her eyes 
and telling him lies
Exactly like she told me too

[CHORUS (repeat ad inf.)]New feeling inside
It's a hot certain kind
I feel hot and cold
Down in my soul, baby

I can't explain
Going out of my mind
Dizzy in the head, and I'm feeling blue
Things you say well maybe they're true
I get funny dreams again and again
Knows what it means, but

Can't explain
I think it's love
Say it to you
When I feel blue

I can't explain, no, I can't explain

You know I can't explain
I'm going out of my mind
Well I'm a worried guy
But I can't explainEarly in the morning by the break of day
That's when my baby went away
Come back baby I wish you would
This crying and grieving
won't do me no good

Hugging and a-kissing, late at night
You know pretty baby it feels just right
Come back baby what you're trying to do
Turning on me and some other men too

Come back baby give me one more chance
You know I still love
you gonna give you romance
Yeah, romance all night long
In my arms, oh yeah

[CHORUS]

Hey pretty baby I love you so
You know pretty baby it hurts me to see you go
Oh yeah [repeat ad inf.]Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
Hey Rosalyn, tell me where you've been
All the night and all the day
Hide and seek's the game you play
Treat me as sure as sin

Oh Rosalyn, yeah Rosalyn

[VERSE]
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
Hey Rosalyn, you're the girl for me
When I'm holding you so tight
It's so hard to say goodnight
It's you that I love now can't you see

[CHORUS]
Do you really love me, do you love me true
Do you really love me Rosalyn
Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn

[VERSE]

[CHORUS]

Yeah gotta know, yeah gotta know
Yeah gotta know Rosalyn
Rosalyn
Yeah Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, Rosalyn, ooh-yeah, ahEmily tries but misunderstands
She's often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams 'til 
tomorrow

[CHORUS]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark Emily cries
Gazing at trees in sorrow hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

[CHORUS]

Put on a gown that touches the ground
Float on a river for ever and ever
Emily

[CHORUS]Shapes of things before my eyes
Just teach me to despise
Will time make man more wise
Here within my lonely frame
My eyes just hurt my brain
But will it seem the same

[CHORUS]
(Come tomorrow), will I be older
(Come tomorrow), maybe a soldier
(Come tomorrow), may I be bolder than today

Now the trees are almost green
But will they still be seen
When time and tide have been
Boy into your passing hands
Please don't destroy these lands
Don't make them desert sands

[CHORUS]

Soon I hope that I will find
A seed within my mind
That won't disgrace my kindWith your long blonde hair
and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you 
was sorrow
Sorrow
You acted funny trying 
to spend my money

You're out there playing your high class games of sorrow
Sorrow

You never do what you know you oughta
Something tells me
you're a Devil's daughter
Sorrow, sorrow
Ahhhh, ah, ahhhh

I tried to find her
'Cause I can't resist her 
(I tried to find her)
I never knew just how much I missed her
Sorrow
Sorrow

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
The only thing I ever got from you was sorrow
Sorrow
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

With your long blonde hair
I couldn't sleep last night
With your long blonde hairIn my life I've never stopped 
to worry about a thing
Opened up and shouted out 
and never tried to see
Wondering if I'd done wrong
Will this depression last for long

[CHORUS]
Won't you tell me
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone
Where have all the good times gone

Once we had an easy ride 
and always felt the same
Time was on our side 
and I had everything to gain
Let it be like yesterday
Please let me have happy days

Ma and Pa looked back on all the things they used to do
Didn't have no money and they always told the truth
Daddy didn't have no toys
And Mummy didn't need no boys

[CHORUS]

Yesterday was such an easy game for you to play
But let's face it things are so much easier today
Guess you need some bringing down
Get your feet back on the ground

[CHORUS]You promised me the ending would be clear
You'd let me know when the time was now
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Stab me in the dark, let me disappear

Memories that flutter like bats out of hell
Stab you from the city spires
Life wasn't worth the balance
Or the crumpled paper it was written on

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible

Hot cash days that you trailed around
Cold cold nights under chrome and glass
Led me down river of perfumed limbs
Sent me to the streets with the good time girls

Don't let me know we're invisible
Don't let me know we're invisible
We could dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire

Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king

Spin-offs with those who slept like corpses
Damp morning rays in the stiff bad clubs
Killing time in the '70s
Smelling of love through the moist winds
Don't let me know when you're opening the door
Close me in the dark, let me disappear
Soon there'll be nothing left of me
Nothing left to release

Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Dance, dance, dance thru' the fire
Feed me no lies
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Breathe through the years
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Bring me the disco king
I don't know about you, I don't know about you
Dead or alive, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco king
Bring me the disco king, bring me the disco kingHold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe youHope little girl
Come blow me away
I don't care much
I win anyway
Just a dog

I'm God damn rich
An exploding man
When I talk in the night
There's oil on my hands
What a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon

Devil in a market place
Devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dog

There's always a moron
Someone to hate
A corporate tie
A wig and a date
Just a dog

These blackest of years
That have no sound
No shape, no depth
No underground
What a dog

Fall dog is cruel and smart
Smart time breaks the heart
Fall dog bombs the moon

A devil in a market place
A devil in your bleeding face
Fall dog bombs the moon
What a dogSilver leaves are spinning round
Take my hand as we go down and down and down
Looking for water
But I lost God in a New York minute
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it
(Looking looking looking)
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
(Looking looking looking)
I can't breathe the air
Can't raise the fight
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night
And I'm

Leave it all behind nothing will be found

Looking everywhere
Looking for water
Looking here and there
I'm looking for water
I'm looking for water
Looking for water
(Looking looking)

I can't live in this cage
I can't eat this candy
To the ends of the Earth
To this pain in my head
The look in your eyes
That never means never
The dawns early light
Baby dumb is forever

Think I better go, better get a room
Better take care of me
Again and again

I think about this and I think about personal history
Better take care
I breathe so deep when the movie gets real
When the star turns round
Again and again
He looks me in the eye says he's got his mind on a countdown 3-2-1
Forever

I'm screaming that I'm gonna be living on till the end of time
Forever
The sky splits open to a dull red skull
My head hangs low 'cause it's all over now

And there's never gonna be enough money
And there's never gonna be enough drugs
And I'm never ever gonna get old
There's never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And I'm never ever gonna get low
And I'm never ever gonna get old

Better take care

The moon flows on to the edges of the world because of you
Again and again
And I'm awake in an age of light living it because of you
Better take care
I'm looking at the future solid as a rock because of you
Again and again

Wanna be here and I wanna be there
Living just like you, living just like me
Forever
Putting on my gloves and bury my bones in the marshland
Forever
Think about my soul but I don't need a thing just the ring of the bell in the pure clean air

And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get
I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get
Never ever gonna get oldSee the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go

See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in colour
First a horseback bomber
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
Let's face the music and dance
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way

Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

Well some people try to pick up girls
They get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso

The girls would turn the colour of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado

He could walk down your street
Girls could not resist his stare
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Not like you
Wow!

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole

Well the girls would turn the colour of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado

Well he was only 5'3"
But girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not in New York
Wow!

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his picture nailsTragic youth was looking young and sexy
The tragic youth was wearing tattered black jeans
Bearing arms and flaunting all her mischief
The tragic youth was going down on me

And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear

I built a wall of sound to separate us
And hid among the junk of wretched highs
I sped from Planet X to Planet Alpha
Struggling for reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo
Ha ha ha ha
Whoo hoo

Hey, now my sight is failing in this twilight
Da da da da da da da da da
Now my death is more than just a sad song
Da da da da da da da da da
And I swear
Woo hoo
Yes I swear
Woo hoo

I still don't remember how this happened
I still don't get the wherefores and the whys
I look for sense but I get next to nothing
Hey boy welcome to reality

Ha ha ha ha
Woo hoo

I've been right and I've been wrong
Now I'm back where I started from
Never looked over reality's shoulder

Ha ha ha ha
Huh ha ha ha
Woo hoo

Huh ha ha
Wooh
Woo hoo
WoohShe waited by the moon
She was sick with fear and cold
She felt too old for all of this
Of course she never showed
She lugged her suitcase to the bus
Melted home through the snow
North along riverside

She slips beneath the sheets
A husbands quiet devoted wife
But strangers sad and nervous
By the dawns early light
Loves lies like a dead cloud
On a shabby, yellow lawn
Up on riverside

She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
South along the Hudson

She'll turn the radio high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul
Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson yea

Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea

And she'll drive the big car
And talk herself insane
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now

Way back when Millennium
Meant racing to the light
He promised her a dream-life
He'd take her back to street-life

Away from violent water
With its Cormorants and leaves
Up on riverside

She'll drive the big car
But he'll sit behind
Bursting her bubbles of Ludlow and Grand
South along the Hudson
She'll turn the radio way up high
Find a station playing sad, sad soul

Just a little bit louder now
South along the Hudson

Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea

Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit louder now
Just a little bit angry now
South along the Hudson, yea

She'll drive the big car
He'll sit behind
She'll keep an eye on Jessica
Just a little bit faster now
Just a little bit faster nowStreets damp and warm
Empty smell metal
Weeds between buildings
Pictures on my hard drive
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

Steam under floor
Shards by the mirrors frame
Clouds green and low
No sign, no nothing now
But I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy

All the pages that have turned
All the errors left unlearned, oh
Well I'm the luckiest guy
Not the loneliest guy
In the world
Not me
Not meWay back in time
Someone said try some
I tried some
Now buy some, I bought some...
Oh oh oh
After a while
When I had tried them, denied them
I opened my eyes and I saw you...

Not a thing did I have
Not a thing did I see
'Till I called on your love
And your love came to me
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

Through my life
I've seen grey sky, met big fry
Seen them die to get high...
Ohhh
And when it seemed that I would only be lonely
I opened my eyes and I saw you

Not a thing did I feel
Not a thing did I know
'Till I called on your love
And your love sure did grow
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh

Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Won't you try some
Baby won't you buy some
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohhh(Rick Davies)
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places we have
Where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look over the town
Then you think about all of the strange things
Circulating 'round
CHORUS
It ain't easy
It ain't easy
It ain't easy with all that's going down
All the people have got their problems
That ain't no bad news
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it takes you right up
And sometimes down again
CHORUS
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I got the love of a hootchy-cootchy woman
She's a-callin' from inside
She's a-callin' from inside
She's talkin' to you, too
What the woman really wants
You can give her somethin' too
CHORUS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------Time takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
The wall-to-wall's calling, it lingers, then you forget
You're a rock 'n' roll suicide
You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it
And the clock waits patiently on your song
You walk past the cafe but you don't eat when you've lived too long
You're a rock 'n' roll suicide
Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road
But day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk floats ride your mind
So natural-religiously unkind
Oh, no, love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up, but if I could only make you care
Oh, no, love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, so I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone, just turn on with me
You're not alone, let's turn on and be
You're not alone, gimme your hands
You're wonderful, gimme your hands
You're wonderful, gimme your hands
------------------------------------------------------------------------------Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no, don't say it's true

They got a message
from the Action Man
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too
I've loved
all I've needed to love
Sordid details following"

The shrieking of nothing is killing 
Just pictures of Jap girls 
in synthesis and I
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing

[CHORUS]
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky
We know Major Tom's 4
a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an all-time low

Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no, not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"
One flash of light 
but no smoking pistol

I never done good things
I never done bad things
I never did anything out of the blue, 
Want an axe to break the ice
Wanna come down right now

[CHORUS]

My mother said
to get things done
You'd better not mess 
with Major TomPsychodelicate girl - come out to play
Little metal faced-boy 
don't stay away
They're so war-torn and resigned
she can't talk any more

What are they trying to prove
What would they like to find

It's love back to front and no sides
like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

[CHORUS]
Because you're young 
you'll meet a stranger some night
Because you're young -
what could be nicer for you 
and it makes me sad
So I'll dance my life away
A million dreams, a million scars

He punishes hard 
was loving her such a crime
She took back everything she said
Left him nearly out of his mind
They're people I know - people I love
They seem so unhappy - dead or alive

It's love back to front and no sides 
like I say
These pieces are broken - like I say
These pieces are broken
Hope I'm wrong but I know

[CHORUS]

A million dreams
A million scars
A million [repeat ad inf.]There's a brand new dance
but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes 
do again and again
It's big and it's bland 
full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here

[CHORUS]
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad 
and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep

There's a brand new talk,
but it's not very clear
That people from good homes 
are talking this year
It's loud and tasteless 
and I've heard it before
You shout it while you're dancing 
on the whole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion

[CHORUS]

Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
Beep-beep

Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion

Shiruetto ya kage ga kakumei o miteiru

Silhouettes and shadows
watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
It's no game

Ore genjitsu kara shime dasare
Nani ga okkote irunoka wakara nai

Hitobito wa yubi o orareteiru
Konna dokusaisha ni iyashime rareru nowa kanashii

I am bored from the event
I really don't understand the situation
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees
Couples 'gainst the target
You throw a rock against the road
And it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday,
and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain,
and it makes all the papers 2

Nammin no kiroku eiga

So where's the moral
when people have their fingers broken2
To be insulted by these fascists 
it's so degrading
And it's no game

Shut up! ShutuSilhouettes and shadows
watch the revolution
No more free steps to heaven
Just walkie-talkie - heaven or hearth
Just big heads and drums - full speed and pagan
And it's no game

I am barred from the event
I really don't understand the situation
So where's the moral
People have their fingers broken
To be insulted by these fascists it's so degrading
And it's no game

Documentaries on refugees, 
couples 'gainst the target
Throw a rock against the road,
and it breaks into pieces
Draw the blinds on yesterday, 
and it's all so much scarier
Put a bullet in my brain, 
and it makes all the papers

And it's no game

Children round the world,
put camel shit on the walls

They're making carpets on treadmills,
or garbage sorting

And it's no gameWell I walked in the pouring rain
And I heard a voice that cries 
"It's all in vain"
The voice of doom 
was shining in my room
I just need one day 
somewhere far away
Lord I just need one day

Well I'll be breaking these rocks
And cutting this hay
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks
What's my price to pay

Well the river's so muddy,
but it may come clear
And I know too well what's keeping me here
I'm just the slave of a burning ray
Oh give me the night,
I can't take another sight
Please, please give me the night

[CHORUS]

Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high

Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die

I won't be breaking no rocks
I said "I won't be breaking no rocks"

(I won't be breaking no rocks)
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
(I won't be breaking no rocks) 
When the kingdom comesShe had an horror of rooms 
she was tired 
you can't hide beat 
When I looked in her eyes they were blue but nobody home

She could've been a killer 
if she didn't walk the way she do, 
and she do
She opened strange doors
that we'd never close again

She began to wail jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

[CHORUS (twice)]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keep me running, running scared

She asked me to stay 
and I stole her room
She asked for my love 
and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street
and she can't socialise
Well I love the little girl 
and I'll love her till the day she dies

She wails
Jimmy's guitar sound
jealousies scream
Waiting at the light know what I mean

[CHORUS (twice)]

[CHORUS (twice)]

Run, Run, Run [ad lib]Well I wouldn't buy no merchandise
And I wouldn't go to war
And I mixed with other colours
But the nurse doesn't care
And I hide under blankets
Or did I run away
I really can't remember
Last time I saw the light of day

But I remember Sam 
'cause he was like me

[CHORUS]
Scream like a baby
Sam was a gun
And I never knew his last name
And we never had no fun

Well they came down hard on the faggots
And they came down hard on the street
They came down harder on Sam
And they all knew he was beat
He was thrown into the wagon
Blindfolded, chains,
and they stomped on us
And took away our clothes and things
And pumped us full of strange drugs
And oh I saw Sam falling
Spitting in their eyes
But now I lay me down to sleep
And now I close my eyes
Now I'm learning 
to be a part of soc-society

[CHORUS]

No athletic program, 
no discipline, no book

He just sat in the backseat
swearing he'd seek revenge
But he jumped into the furnace
Singing old songs we loved

[CHORUS (twice)]Well, how come you only want tomorrow
With its promise 
of something hard to do
A real life adventure
worth more than pieces of gold
Blue skies above
and sun on your arms 
strength in your stride
And hope in those squeaky clean eyes
You'll get chilly receptions 
everywhere you go
Blinded with desire 
- guess the season is on

So you train by shadow boxing, 
search for the truth
But it's all, but it's all used up
Break open
your million dollar weapon
And you push , still you push, 
still you push your luck

A broken nosed mogul are you
One of the new wave boys9 

Same old thing in brand new drag
Comes sweeping into view, oh-ooh
As ugly as a teenage millionaire
Pretending
it's a whizz kid world
You'll take me aside, and say
"Well, David, what shall I do
They wait for me in the hallway"
I'll say "Don't ask me, I don't know any hallways"
But they move in numbers and they've got me in a corner
I feel like a group of one, no-no
They can't do this to me
I'm not some piece 
of teenage wildlife

Those midwives to history put on their bloody robes

The word is that the hunted one is out there on his own
You're alone for maybe the last time
And you breathe for a long time
Then you howl like a wolf in a trap
And you daren't look behind

You fall to the ground
like a leaf from the tree
And look up one time 
at that vast blue sky
Scream out aloud as they shoot you down
No no, I'm not a piece 
of teenage wildlife
I'm not a piece 
of teenage wildlife

And no one will have seen 
and no one will confess
The fingerprints will prove 
that you coudn't pass the test
There'll be others 
on the line filing past, 
who'll whisper low
I miss you he really had to go
Well each to his own, he was
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wildlife, oh-oh-oh-ohh
Another piece of teenage wild...
Wild 
Wild
WildThe vacuum created 
by the arrival of freedom
And the possibilities it seems to offer
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it 
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it

A series of shocks - sneakers fall apart
Earth keeps on rolling 
witnesses falling
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it

Yeah, yeah, yeah 
up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-ooo

While we sleep they go to work
We're legally crippled
it's the death of love
It's got nothing to do with you,
if one can grasp it
It's got nothing to do with you, 
if one can grasp it

More idols than realities
I'm OK, you're so-so

Yeah, yeah, yeah - up the hill backwards
It'll be alright ooo-oooDo you remember a guy that's been

Sometimes you get so lonelyheaven loves ya
 the clouds smile for ya
 nothing stands in your way when you're a boy
 clothes always fit ya
 life is the pop of a cherry when you're a boy

 when you're a boy
   other boys check you out
 you get a girl
   these are your favorite things

 unpage the colors
 unfurl the flag

   you can buy a home of your own
 when you're a boy
   learn to drive and everything
 you get a girl
   you'll get your share
 when you're a boy.And my time was running wild
A million dead-end streets
Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seems the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Ch-ch-changes
Don't have to be a richer man
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Ch-ch-changes
Don't want to be a better man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream
Of warm impermanence
So the days flow through my eyes
But the days still seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consolations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Ch-ch-changes
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it
Ch-ch-changes
Where's your shame
You've left us up to our necks in it
Time may change them
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Ch-ch-changes
Look out you rock 'n' rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes
Ch-ch-changes
Pretty soon you're gonna get a little older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time(David Bowie/Iggy Pop)
I could escape this feeling, with my China Girl
I feel a wreck without my, little China Girl
I hear her heart beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing
I'm a mess without my, little China Girl
Wake up mornings where's my, little China Girl
I hear her heart's beating, loud as thunder
Saw they stars crashing down
I feel a-tragic like I'm Marlon Brando
When I look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
When I look at my China Girl
I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
Plans for everyone
It's in the whites of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says
Oh baby just you shut your mouth
She says ... sh-sh-shhh====

I'm home, lost my job, and incurably ill
You think this is easy, realism
I've got a girl out there, I suppose
I think she's dancing
Feel like Dan Dare lies down
I think she's dancing, what do I know?
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, no, oh no
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me, oh
One more, weekend, of lights and evening faces
Fast food, living nostalgia
Humble pie or bitter fruit
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can't turn around no, can't turn around no, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I say
Can't turn around no, can't turn around, ooh
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I've got believers (kiss-kiss)
Believing me
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no, can't turn around
I am a D.J., I am what I play
Can turn around no (kiss-kiss)
Time flies when you're having fun
Break his heart, break her heart
He used to be my boss and millions of puppet dancer
I am a D.J., and I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers
I've got believers in me
I've got believers
I am a D.J., I am what I play
I am a D.J.============
(spoken) This ain't rock'n'roll.  This is genocide!
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I'm sure you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The diamond dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal
CHORUS
(Will they come?)
  I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
  Oh baby, come unto me
(Will they come?)
  Well, she's come, been and gone.
  Come out of the garden, baby
  You'll catch your death in the fog
  Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
  Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzie, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralyzed, Diamond Dogs are sable-ized
CHORUS
Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs (x2)
In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) try and wake up tomorrow
CHORUS
Ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs (x2)
Bow-wow, woof woof, bow-wow, wow
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Dogs
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, call them, ooo
Call them the Diamond Dogs
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs (repeat)=================
Let me put my arms around your head
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed
Don't forget to turn on the light
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright
Pour me out another phone
I'll ring and see if your friends are home
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome
Can lend us a book we can read up alone
And try to get it on like once before
When people stared in Jagger's eyes and scored
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday
Jung the foreman prayed at work
That neither hands nor limbs would burst
It's hard enough to keep formation with this fall out saturation
Cursing at the Astronette
Who stands in steel by his cabinet
He's crashing out with Sylvian
The Bureau Supply for ageing men
With snorting head he gazes to the shore
Which once had raised a sea that raged no more
Like the video films we saw
His name was always Buddy
And he'd shrug and ask to stay
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid
And turn her face away
She's uncertain if she likes him
But she knows she really loves him
It's a crash course for the ravers
It's a Drive-in Saturday

It's a Drive-in Saturday (repeat)====
(David Bowie/John Lennon/Carlos Alomar)
Fame, makes a man take things over
Fame, lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, puts you there where things are hollow
Fame
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you insane
Fame
Fame, what you like is in the limo
Fame, what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, what you need you have to borrow
Fame
Fame, "Nien! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to, crime
Fame
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Really, really?
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, fame, fame, fame
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on pain
Fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(whispered)
  Feeling so gay, feeling gay=======
There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name
That people from bad homes do again and again
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear
They do it over there but we don't do it here
Fashion!  Turn to the left
Fashion!  Turn to the right
Oooh, fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no
Beep-beep
There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear
Oh bop
That people from good homes are talking this year
Oh bop, fashion
It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before
Oh bop
You shout it while you're dancing on the ole dance floor
Oh bop, fashion
Fashion! Turn to the left
Fashion! Right
Fashion!
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town
Beep-beep
Beep-beep
Listen to me - don't listen to me
Talk to me - don't talk to me

Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby
There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby
Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I-I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins-like dolphins can swim
Though nothing-nothing will keep us together
We can beat them-for ever and ever
Oh we can be heroes-just for one day
I-I will be king
And you-you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them-just for one day
We can be heroes-just for one day
And you-you can be mean
And I-I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers-and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers-and that is that
Though nothing-will keep us together
We could steal time-just for one day
We can be heroes-for ever and ever
What do you say?
I-I can remember
Standing-by the wall
And the guns-shot above our heads
And we kissed-as though nothing could fall
And the shame-was on the other side
Oh we can beat them-forever and ever
Then we could be heroes-just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
Just for one day
We can be heroes
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh-oh, oh, oh, ohhh, just for one day
Oh just for a day=============
It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling "No"
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream
To the seat with the clearest view
And she's hooked to the silver screen
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on Amerikas tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the Norfolk Broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
To my mother, my dog, and clowns
But the film is a saddening bore
'Cause I wrote it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! Look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the Lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?==================
(David Bowie/Brian Eno)
"You know who I am," he said
The speaker was an angel
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings
Closed his eyes and moved his lips
"It's time we should be going"
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes
Till you come
No one seemed to hear him
So he leafed through a magazine
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away
Very sane he seemed to me
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, driven by the night
Till you come
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice
Till you come
(Waiting so long, ahhh...)
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) (repeat ad inf.)===========
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo (3 times)
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
CHORUS
  Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
  Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess

  Hot tramp, I love you so!

You've got your mother in a whirl 'cause she's
Not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight

Doo doo doo-doo doo doo doo doo (2 times)
CHORUS
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know
Calamity's child, chi-chile, chi-chile
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooo, your face is a mess
Ooo, ooo, so how could they know?
Eh, eh, how could they know?
Eh, eh================
Ahhh...

Doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Doo, doo, doo, do-doh
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing, waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude, over my head
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision==============
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back plazas
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes right
Poor little Greenie
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!
Sits like a man but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!
He's so simple minded he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved, loves to be loved
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
Jean Genie let yourself go!
  (repeat)I recall how we lived
On the corner of a bed
And we'd speak of a Swedish room
Of hessian and wood
And we'd talk with our eyes
Of the sweetness in our lives
And tomorrows of rich surprise...
Some things we could do

In our madness
We burnt one hundred days
Time takes time to pass
And I still hold some ashes to me
An Occasional Dream

And we'd sleep, oh so close
But not really close our eyes
'Tween the sheets of summer 
bathed in blue...
Gently weeping nights
It was long, long ago
And I can't touch your name

For the days of fate 
were strong for you...
Danced you far from me

In my madness
I see your face in mine
I keep a photograph
It burns my wall with time
Time
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mine
An Occasional Dream
Of mineI bless you madly, 
sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, 
Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it's you 
that sets the test

So much has gone 
and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The Thinker sits alone growing older
And so bitter

"I gave Them life
I gave Them all
They drained my very soul
...dry
I crushed my heart 
to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can They spare
What of me
Who praised Their efforts 
to be free
Words of strength and care 
and sympathy
I opened doors
that would have blocked Their way
I braved Their cause to guide, 
for little pay

I ravaged at my finance just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility 
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me"

I bless you madly, 
sadly as I tie my shoes
I love you badly, just in time,
at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest, oh yes
Because it's you 
that sets the test

So much has gone
and little is new
And as the sunrise stream
Flickers on me,
My friends talk
Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word

"We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men, but Ours

We used him
We let him use his powers
We let him fill Our needs
Now We are strong

And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have no time to make amends
No purse of token fortune stands in Our way
The silent guns of love
will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure built of age
Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage

Where money stood
We planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers
Sons of dirt

Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor
on slogans such as

'Wish You Could Hear'
'Love Is All We Need'
'Kick Out The Jams'
'Kick Out Your Mother'
'Cut Up Your Friend'
'Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End'

And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe"

And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain
It said:
"I believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"

And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain
on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore 
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich

And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls 'Now'
And I want to Believe
That a light's shining through
Somehow

And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe
And We Want to Live
Oh, We Want to Live

We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live
We Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

I Want to Live
I Want to Live
I Want to Live

Live
Live
LiveI was walking through the counters of a national concern
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder

And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak
Into the paper bag at her side
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind

Crying
"God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God may look the other way today"

Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag
Perspiration trickled down her forehead
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder
She was led away bewildered and amazed
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter
As her escort asked her softly 
for her name
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady
Who had fainted to the whirling 
wooden floor

Crying
"God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
the other way

God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
God knows I'm good
Surely God won't look
the other way"Oh my love, Janine
I'm helpless for your smile
Like a Polish wanderer
I travel ever onwards to your land
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand

Your strange demand
To 'collocate' my mind
Scares me into gloom
You're too intense
I'll have to keep you in your place
I've no defence
I've got to keep my veil on my face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash 
my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at all

You're fey, Janine
A tripper to the last
But if I catch you standing on my toes
I'll have a right to shout you down
For you're a lazy stream
In which my thoughts would drown

So stay, Janine
And we can glide along
I've caught your wings for laughs
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year
So take your glasses off
And don't act so sincere

Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well
But I've got things inside my head
That even I can't face

Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash
my walls
But if you take an axe to me
You'll kill another man
Not me at allThe hand that wrote this letter
Sweeps the pillow clean.
So rest your head and read a treasured dream.
I care for no one else but you.
I tear my soul to cease the pain.
I think maybe you feel the same,
What can we do?
I'm not quite sure what we're supposed to do.
So I've been writing just for you.
They say your life is going very well.
They say you sparkle like a different girl.
But something tells me that you hide
When all the world is warm and tired.
You cry a little in the dark,
Well so do I.
I'm not quite sure what you're supposed to say,
But I can see it's not okay.
He makes you laugh
He brings you out in style.
He treats you well
And makes you up real fine.
And when he's strong,
He's strong for you.
And when you kiss
It's something new.
But did you ever call my name
Just by mistake?
I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do.
So I'll just write some love to you.The hand that wrote this letter

So I'll just write some love to youThe Children of the summer's end
Gathered in the dampened grass
We played Our songs and felt the London sky
Resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven

Touch, We touched the very soul
Of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day

Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love
upon a white balloon
And fly it from 
the topest top of all the tops 
That man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something 
just the same

We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head
And away they soared
Climbing through 
the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd
And We walked back to the road, unchained

LiveSpy, spy, pretty girl
I see you see me through your window
Don't turn your nose up
Well, you can if you need to, you won't be the first or last

It must strain you to look down so far from your father's house
And I know what a louse like me in his house could do for you
I'm the Cream
Of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam
In the depths 
of your banker's spleen

I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain
I keep having this brainstorm 
About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm Unwashed 
and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
Look out, I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

Now you run from your window
To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly
It's very catching
So now, you should spend the mornings lying to your father quite amazed
About the strange Unwashed and Happily Slightly Dazed.Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
And the hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
'Neath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry:

"It's really Me
Really You
And really Me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really You
And really Me
You'll lose me though I'm always 
really free"

And the mountain moved its eyes
To the world of realize
Where the snow had saved a place
For the Wild Eyed Boy
from Freecloud

And the village Dreadful cried
As the rope began to rise
For the smile stayed on the face
Of the Wild Eyed Boy 
from Freecloud
And the women once proud
Clutched the heart of the crowd
As the boulders smashed down from the mountain's hand

And the Magic in the stare
Of the Wild Eyed Boy said
"Stop, Freecloud 
They won't think to cut me down"
But the cottages fell
Like a playing card hell
And the tears on the face
Of the Wise Boy
Came tumbling down
To the rumbling ground
And the missionary mystic of peace/love
Stumbled to cry among the clouds
Kicking back the pebbles
From the Freecloud mountain
Track.(Brian Wilson/Tony Asher )
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows
What I'd be without you...
(J. Ferrar/P. Robinson)
I've seen so many smiling faces today
But just what lies behind them I can't see
I've lived my life in many places it seems
Now I just don't know where I want to be
Cause home ain't home anymore
No more
My heart ain't here anymore
No more
The years have opened up a canyon it seems
A canyon deep and wide that I can't cross
And though my nomad days have opened my eyes
I learned that every game must have a lost
Cause home ain't home anymore
No more
My heart ain't here anymore
No more
Don't be afraid to tell me that things are not the same
I'm older now and wiser
I know how things can change
Cause home ain't home anymore
No more
My heart ain't here anymore
No more...Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop 

Don't let me hear you say life's 
taking you nowhere,
angel

Come get up my baby
Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young
Come get up my baby

[CHORUS]
There's my baby lost that's all
Once I'm begging 
you save her little soul
Golden years, gold, whop, whop, whop
Come get up my baby

Last night they loved you,
opening doors
and pulling some strings, angel
Come get up my baby
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, 
act fine
Come get up my baby

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop
Come get up my baby

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down 
where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car 
twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet,
don't break my heart
Doing all right,
but you gotta get smart
Wish upon, wish upon, day upon day, I believe oh lord
I believe all the way
Come get up my baby

[CHORUS]

Don't let me hear you say life's 
taking you nowhere, 
angel

Come get up my baby
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
Golden years, gold whop whop whop [Repeat]The return of the Thin White Duke 
throwing darts
in lovers' eyes 
Here are we one magical moment
Such is the stuff from 
where dreams are woven
Bending sound
Dredging the ocean lost in my circle
Here am I
Flashing no colour tall in this room 
overlooking the ocean

Here are we
One magical movement 
from Kether to Malkuth 1 
There are you
You drive like a demon 
from station to station
The return of the Thin White Duke 
throwing darts 
in lovers' eyes [x2]
The return of the Thin White Duke, 
making sure white stains

Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sunbirds
to soar with
And once I could 
never be down
Got to keep searching 
and searching
Oh what will I be believing 
and who will connect me with love

Wonder who wonder who
wonder when
Have you sought fortune evasive and shy
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink drink drain your glass
raise your glass high

[CHORUS 1]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love
It's too late 
- to be grateful
It's too late 
- to be late again
It's too late 
- to be hateful
The european cannon is here

[CHORUS 2]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass 
without her
It's too late 
- to be grateful
It's too late 
- to be late again
It's too late 
- to be hateful
The European cannon is here

[CHORUS 3]
Should I believe that I've been stricken
Does my face show 
some kind of glow
It's too late
- to be grateful
It's too late
- to be late again
It's too late
- to be hateful
The european cannon is here, yes it's here

It's too late [5 times]
The European cannon is here

[CHORUS 1]

[CHORUS 2]

[CHORUS 3]

It's too late [repeat ab inf]This week dragged past me 
so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could 
get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[CHORUS]
Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is
stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody wants something you want too

Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, 
make me delight
Right is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say or do something
But what I never say is 
stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell 
When somebody 
Wants something or wants to stay 

[CHORUS]Up every evening 'bout half eight or nine
I give my complete attention 
to a very good friend of mine
He's quadraphonic, he's a, 
he's got more channels
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five
I brought my baby home, she
She sat around forlorn
She saw my T V C one five, baby's gone, she
She crawled right in, oh my
She crawled right in my
So hologramic, 
oh my T V C one five
Oh, so demonic, 
oh my T V C one five

Maybe if I pray every, each night I sit there pleading 

"Send back 
my dream test baby, 
She's my main feature"
My T V C one five, he, he just 
Stares back unblinking
So hologramic,
oh my T V C one five
One of these nights I may just
Jump down that rainbow way, be with my baby, then

We'll spend some time together
So hologramic, oh my T V C one five
My baby's in there someplace
Love's rating in the sky
So hologramic,
oh my T V C one five

[CHORUS]Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress, satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind, wild is the wind

[CHORUS]
You touch me, 
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me, all things to me
Don't you know, you're life itself!

Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures of the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

[CHORUS]

Like the leaf clings to the tree,
Oh, my darling, cling to me
For we're like creatures in the wind, and wild is the wind
Wild is the windIn this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life
out of my dreams
I don't need another change 
Still you forced away 
into my scheme of things

You say we're growing,
growing heart and soul
In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life
out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Oh sweet name, I call you again
You're born once again for me
Just because I believe don't mean I don't think as well
Don't have to question everything 
in heaven or hell

[CHORUS]
Lord, I kneel and offer you 
my word on a wing
And I'm trying hard to fit 
among your scheme of things

It's safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I don't stand in my own light
Lord, lord, my prayer flies
like a word on a wing

My prayer flies 
like a word on a wing
Does my prayer fit in 
with your scheme of things

In this age of grand illusion 
You walked into my life 
out of my dreams
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
Just as long as I can see, I'll never stop this vision flowing
I look twice and you're still flowing
Just as long as I can walk
I'll walk beside you, I'm alive in you
Sweet name, you're born once again for me
And I'm ready to shape the scheme of things

Ooh, ready to shape 
the scheme of things [5 times]

[CHORUS]Down where your paint is cracking
Look down you backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash
Everybody always wants to kiss your trash
You can't help him
Nobody can
Now that he knows
There's nothing to get
Will you still place your bet
On the neighborhood threat
Somewhere a baby's bleeding
Somewhere a mother's needing
Outside a boy is lying
But mostly he is crying
And he just shouts in anger
You'll find him interesting
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he doesn't build for you
Everybody always wants to run with youPlease trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo

There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo

We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, 
From paradise 
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball. 
Won't someone invite them 
They're just taller children, that's all, after all 

Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo 
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo 
Some people are marching together and some on their own
Quite alone 
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl
But some sit in silence, they're just older children 
That's all, after all 

I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords, with my words 
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called 
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children At all, after all 
Live till your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo 
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo 

After all, after allDay after day 
They send my friends away 
To mansions cold and grey 
To the far side of town 
Where the thin men stalk the streets 
While the sane stay underground 

Day after day 
They tell me I can go 
They tell me I can blow 
To the far side of town 
Where it's pointless to be high 
'Cause it's such a long way down 
So I tell them that 
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm 

I will do me harm 
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all...am I 

Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be 
Just my librium and me 
And my E.S.T. makes three 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen roaming free 

And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me 

(Where can the horizon lie 
When a nation hides 
Its organic minds in a cellar...dark and grim
They must be very dim) 

Day after day 
They take some brain away 
Then turn my face around 
To the far side of town 
And tell me that it's real 
Then ask me how I feel 

Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall 
I'm not quite right at all 
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be 
My libido's split on me 
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy 

'Cause I'd rather stay here 
With all the madmen 
Than perish with the sadmen 
Roaming free And I'd rather play here 
With all the madmen 
For I'm quite content 
They're all as sane as me 
Zane, Zane, Zane Ouvre le Chien [rpt]Pack a pack horse up and rest up here on
Black Country Rock

You never know, you might find it here on
Black Country Rock

Some say the view is crazy
But you may adopt another point of view
So if it's much too hazy
You can leave my friend and me with fond adieuI count the corpses on my left, I find I'm not so tidy
So I better get away, better make it today
I've cut twenty-three down since Friday
But I can't control it, my face is drawn
My instinct still emotes it

I slash them cold, I kill them dead
I broke the gooks, I cracked their heads
I'll bomb them out from under the beds
But now I've got the running gun blues

It seems the peacefuls stopped the war
Left generals squashed and stifled
But I'll slip out again tonight
Cause they haven't taken back my rifle
For I promote oblivion
And I'll plug a few civilians

I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead
I'll break them gooks, I'll crack their heads
I'll slice them till they're running red
But now I've got the running gun bluesPresident Joe once had a dream
The world held his hand, gave their pledge

So he told them his scheme for a Saviour Machine

They called it the Prayer, its answer was law
Its logic stopped war, gave them food
How they adored till it cried in its boredom

'Please don't believe in me, please disagree with me

Life is too easy, a plague seems quite feasible now
or maybe a war, or I may kill you all

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away

Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour Machine

I need you flying, and I'll show that dying

Is living beyond reason, sacred dimension of time
I perceive every sign, I can steal every mind

Don't let me stay, don't let me stay
My logic says burn so send me away

Your minds are too green, I despise all I've seen
You can't stake your lives on a Saviour MachineWe met upon a hill, the night was cool and still
She sucked my dormant will
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me cold

I had no time to spare, I grabbed her golden hair
And threw her to the ground
Father, she craved my head, Oh Lord, the things she said
My God, she should be told

I was very smart, broke the gentle hearts
Of many young virgins

I was quick on the ball, left them so lonely
They'd just give up trying

Then she took my head, smashed it up
Kept my young blood rising
Crushed me mercilessly, kept me going around

So she didn't know I crave her so-o-o

I'll give my love in vain, to reach that peak again
We met upon a hill
Mother, she blew my brain, I will go back again
My God, she shook me coldWe passed upon the stair, we spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there, he said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone, a long long time ago

Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With The Man Who Sold The World

I laughed and shook his hand, and made my way back home
I searched for form and land, for years and years I roamed

I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here
We must have died alone, a long long time ago

Who knows not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the Man who Sold the WorldWhen all the world was very young
And mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with superfear their tragic endless lives

Could heave nor sigh
In solemn, perverse serenity, wondrous beings chained to life

Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly a supergod cries

Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Where sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers

Nightmare dreams no mortal mind could hold
A man would tear his brother's flesh, a chance to die
To turn to mold.

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod cries 

Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes
Strange, mad celebration
So softly a supergod diesIn the corner of the morning in the past
I would sit and blame the master first and last
All the roads were straight and narrow
And the prayers were small and yellow
And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping by a tree.

And I looked and frowned and the monster was me

Well, I said hello and I said hello
And I asked "Why not" and I replied "I don't know"
So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be

And he laughed insane and quipped "KAHLIL GIBRAN"
So I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
For I realized that God's a young man too

So I said "So long" and I waved "Bye-bye"
And I smashed my soul and traded my mind

Got laid by a young bordello
I was vaguely half asleep
For which my reputation swept back home in drag

And the moral of this magic spell
Negotiates my hide
When God did take my logic for a ride
(Riding along)

He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
And showed me the leather belt round his hips
My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
He said "You'll never go down to the Gods again"
(Turn around,go back!)

He struck the ground a cavern appeared
And I smelt the burning pit of fear
We crashed a thousand yards below
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around,go back!)

His nebulous body swayed above
His tongue swollen with devil's love
The snake and I, a venom high
I said "Do it again, do it again"
(Turn around, go back!)

Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply

And I was seething, breathing deeply
Spitting sentry, horned and tailed

Waiting for youBlue Jean-I just met me a girl  named Blue Jean

Blue Jean-she got a camouflaged face and no money
Remember they always let you down when you need 'em

Oh, Blue Jean - is heaven any sweeter than Blue Jean
She got a police bike
She got a turned up nose

Sometimes I feel like
(Oh, the whole human race)
Jazzin' for Blue Jean
(Oh, and when my Blue Jean's blue)
Blue Jean can send me
(Oh, somebody send me)
Somebody send me
(Oh, somebody send me)

One day I'm gonna write a poem in a letter
One day I'm gonna get that faculty together
Remember that everybody has to wait in line
Blue Jean-look out world you know I've got mine
She got Latin roots
She got everythingSomething's going on in society

They're making sorta crazy sounds
Don't look down, no
Don't know who else came to kneel
On this empty battlefield
But when I hear that crazy sound, I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

I went this morning to the cemetery
To see old Rudy 
Valentino buried
Lipstick traces on his name
He never looked down
'Cause they were making crazy sounds
From Central Park to shanty town
He always heard that crazy sound
There's always something else
Don't look down, no

When I see you standing there
I can't see the clothes you wear
I just hear that crazy sound
And I can't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I've always heard that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down, no
Don't look down
Don't look, don't look down

No I won't be bored I won't be there
Look at life it's no piece of cake
When I hear that crazy sound
I don't look down
From Central Park to shanty town
I always hear that crazy sound
From New York to shanty town
There's always something else
Don't look down
Don't look down, no
Well, don't look, 
don't look downIf you should ever leave me
My life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you 

I may not always love you
But as long as there are 
stars above you
You'll never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without youI keep forgetting
you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting 
you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting 
that you told me that you
Didn't want me around any more
But these stupid old feet
Just head for your street
Like they've done so many times before
And this stubborn old fist
On the end of my wrist
Keeps a knocking on your front door

I keep forgetting
you don't love me no more
I keep forgetting
you don't want me no more
I keep forgetting 
bout those heartbreaking nights

And those heartbreaking things
That you said
Though I know in my heart
We're drifting apart
I can't believe 
that our love is dead

Though it's plain as can be
That you're finished with me
I just can't get it through my headWatching them come and go
The Templars and the Saracens
They're travelling the holy land
Opening telegrams

Torture comes and torture goes
Knights who'd give you anything
They bear the cross of Coeur de Leon
Salvation for the mirror blind

But if you pray 
all your sins are hooked upon the sky
Pray and the heathen lie will disappear
Prayers they hide
the saddest view
(Believing the strangest things,
loving the alien)

And your prayers they break the sky in two
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

You pray til the break of dawn
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

And you'll believe you're loving the alien
(Believing the strangest things, loving the alien)

Thinking of a different time
Palestine a modern problem
Bounty and your wealth in land
Terror in a best laid plan

Watching them come and go
Tomorrows and the yesterdays
Christians and the unbelievers
Hanging by the cross and nailDown where your paint is cracking
Look down your backstairs buddy
Somebody's living there and
He don't really feel the weather
And he don't share your pleasures
No he don't share your pleasures
Look at his eyes
Did you see his crazy eyes
You're so surprised he don't run to catch your ash

Everybody always wants to run with youI saw my baby
She was turning blue
I knew that soon
Her young life was through
And so I got down on my knees
Down by her bed
And these are the words
To her I said

Everything will be alright tonight
Everything will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
Everyone will be alright tonight
No one moves
No one talks
No one thinks
No one walks tonight
Tonight

I am gonna love you till the end
I will love you till I reach the end
I will love you till I die
I will see you in the sky
TonightI've seen the city
I took the next flight
For Borneo
They say it's pretty
I like the tee shirts
In Borneo
Some wear Bob Marley
Others in Playboy
Or Duvalier
Make the last plane come
Let me rise through the cloudy above
With a book on Borneo

Strangers come and go
It's such a waste of time
Problems far behind
Another day
But even in springtime
It's a rich slice of life
So send me a letter
I'll reply with a broken spear
That dusky mulatto
In nylons and tattoos
Hot juice in coke bottles
We dance in the sand
Well, they twirl and they tumble

Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble
I've been to Leon's
He's got nine daughters
And a stereo
They say that Leon
Watches from the tree tops
In Borneo
When the road is mud
Everything stops with a thud
That's the way it goes down
yonder in Borneo
Far beneath his mansion
There's an open drain
Sending all the sewage down the hill
But when the general shows movies
No one hesitates
To sneak from the jungle
They laugh and they mumble
Enjoying the show
And that dusky mulatto

Hot juice in coke bottles
In Blue Jeans and tattoos
Well, they twirl and they tumble
Yes, they twirl and they tumble
Well, I'll twirl and I'll tumble

I like the free world
They say it's pretty
This time of year
They tumble and twirl [x2]
I'll tumble and twirl

They twirl and they tumble [x2]

I like the free world [x2]

They say it's pretty

This time of year [x2]Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup 
They slither wildly as they slip away
Across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[CHORUS (twice)]
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a 
Million eyes
They call me on and on 
Across the universe
Thoughts meander like the restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe

[CHORUS 1 (twice)]

Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my 
open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on and on
Across the universe

[CHORUS (twice)]Once we were lovers, can they understand
Closer than others I was your, I was your man
Don't talk of heartaches, ohh, I remember them all
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm Faking it all

[CHORUS]
Can you hear me
Can you feel me inside
Show your love, love
Take it in right (take it in right)
Take it in right (take it in right)

There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times
Sixty new cities, an' what do I, what do I
What do I find

[CHORUS (twice)]

[ad-lib]Hey Jack, I better shake it off
Put her out of my head
The thinking of all, just another young girl last night
Oh brother! I left a woman
in that morning day
Been on that trip so many times
Good-God! was really yesterday
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many
many ways
I've lied and taken off into the day,
leaving another girl to
weep over the breakfast tray
Loved her before I knew her name
Hit me! Jack, 'cause I'm
gone! love her way

It's gonna be me, yeah
Let's play, not play this record
Waitin' for the telephone to ring
Wiped-out and bitter, with a
bag clutched in her hand
All the cars sound like they're
pulling in the drive
Umm, no, no, no, no, no, uhh
I see her now
A little tear running down her check
Laugh! Let down
People looking for me
I want to race down her street
and knock hard, hard, hard on the door 'til
Until she breaks down in my arms like a
*Tracy tie*, yell "I feel the pain" {?}
I'll be so strong again and again
Come back my brain, yeah
I'm holy again
I'll take ya, oww, babe, baby, baby
We're gonna have, oww, baby, baby,

Blessing all the papers, thanking one and all
Hugging all the babies, kissing all the ladies
Knowing all that you think about from writing on the wall
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race
He says "I'm somebody"
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
He's the savage son of the TV tube
Planets wrote the day was due
All the wisest men around
Predicted that a man was found
Who looked a lot like you and me, yeah
Everyone with sense could see
Nothing left his eye unmoved, he
Had the plan, he had to use
He's so divine, his soul shines
Breaks the night, sleep tight
His ever loving face smiles on the whole human race

He says "I'm somebody"
He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
Somebody plays my song in tune
Makes me, makes me, makes me stronger for you, babe
Was a way when we were young, that
Any man was judged by what he'd done
But now you pick them on the screen (what they look like) 
Where they've been

He's got his eye on your soul, his hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
Leaders come, they hate all the people know
That given time, the leaders go
Tell me, can they hold you under their spell
Can they walk and hold you as well as a
Smile like Valentino
Could he sell you anything
Keep your eyes on your soul, keep your hand on your heart

He says "Don't hurry, baby
Somebody up there (somebody) likes me"
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody

Everybody knows it's true
Everybody feels that

Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life
I knew you found your sight
and nothing would be quite the same
Please help me

Felled apart, you found me

I feel you driving and you're only the wheel
Slow down, let someone love you
Ohh, I've never touched you since I started to feel
If there's nothing to hide me
Then you've never seen me hanging naked and wired
Somebody lied, I say it's hip
To be alive

[CHORUS]
Now your smile is wearing (spreading) thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is win
Me, I'm fresh on your pages
Secret thinker sometimes listening aloud
Life lies dumb on its heroes
Wear your wound with honor, make someone proud
Someone like you should not be allowed
To start any fires

[CHORUS]
Now your smile is wearing (spreading) thin
Seems you're trying not to lose
Since I'm not supposed to win
All you've got to do is winThey pulled in just behind the bridge
He lays her down, he frowns
"Gee my life's a funny thing, am I
still too young"
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows, she'd have taken anything, but

[CHORUS (She)]
All night
She wants the young American
Young American, young American, she wants the young American
All right
She wants the young American

Scanning life through the picture
window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford
Mustang, but
Heaven forbid, she'll take anything
But the freak, and his type, all for 
nothing
He misses a step and cuts his hand, but
Showing nothing, he swoops like a song
She cries "Where have all Papa's heroes gone"

[CHORUS (She)]
All the way from Washington
Her bread-winner begs off the bathroom floor
We live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more"

[CHORUS (HE)]
All night
He wants the young American
Young American, young American, 
he wants the young American
All right
He wants the young American

Do you remember, your President Nixon
Do you remember, the bills you have to pay
Or even yesterday
Have been the un-American
Just you and your idol sing falsetto
'bout Leather, leather everywhere, and
Not a myth left from the ghetto
Well, well, well, would you carry a razor
In case, just in case of depression
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-Sheeners
Ain't that close to love
Well, ain't that poster love
Well, it ain't that Barbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you

[CHORUS (YOU)]
All night
You want the young American
Young American, young American, you want the young American
All right
You want the young American

You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
A pimp's got a Cadi and a lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect, and white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps, and look at your hands ache
(I heard the news today, oh boy)
I got a suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man who can say no more 
And, ain't there a woman I can 
sock on the jaw
And, ain't there a child I can hold without judging
Ain't there a pen that will write before they die
Ain't you proud that you've still got faces
Ain't there one damn song that can make me
break down and cry

[CHORUS (I) (repeat 3 times ad lib)]
All night
I want the young American
Young American, young American, I want the young American
All right
I want the young AmericanPushing thru the market 
square
so many mothers sighing
News had just come over, 
we had five years left to cry in

News guy wept and told us 
earth was really dying
Cried so much his face was wet
then I knew he was not lying

I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s
My brain hurt like a warehouse
it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things 
to store everything in there
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

A girl my age went off her head
hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them

A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheel of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
and a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
drinking milk shakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
don't think you knew you were in this song

And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
We've got five years, that's all we've gotWell she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the 
show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh 
collector
Layin' on 'lectric dreams

[CHORUS]
So come on, come on 
we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yourself

We can't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're the Spiders from Mars

[CHORUS (x3)]

Come on, ah, come on, ah [repeat ad inf.]When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea
Think about the places perhaps, where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round 

[CHORUS]
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down 

Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord
We can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again

[CHORUS]

Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Koochie woman
She calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something 
too

[CHORUS (x2)]People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace

The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[CHORUS]
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight 
([second time:] really quite paradise)
And he sang all night long

Femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey

Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

[CHORUS]

Oh how I sighed 
When they asked if I knew his name

[CHORUS]

Get some pussy now!I'm an alligator, I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm the space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, 
you're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love

Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah!

Don't fake it baby, lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Make me baby, make me know you really care

Make me jump into the air

Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream oh yeah! 

Freak out, far out, in outTime takes a cigarette, puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your 
cigarette
The wall-to-wall is calling, it lingers, then you forget
Ohhh, you're a rock 'n' roll suicide

You're too old to lose it, too young to choose it

And the clock waits so patiently on your song
You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you've lived 
too long
Oh, no, no, no, you're a rock 'n' roll suciide

Chev brakes are snarling as you stumble across the road

But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
Don't let the sun blast your shadow
Don't let the milk float ride your mind
You're so natural - religiously unkind

Oh no love! you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
You got your head all tangled up but if I could only make you care
Oh no love! you're not alone
No matter what or who you've been
No matter when or where you've seen
All the knives seem to lacerate your brain
I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain
You're not alone 

Just turn on with me and you're not alone 
Let's turn on with me and you're not alone
Let's turn on and be not alone
Gimme your hands cause you're wonderful [x2]
Oh gimme your hands.Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life 
to save the slogans
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving

New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts

To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[CHORUS]
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenceless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness 
evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him

[CHORUS]Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile 
as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well he can tell you that 
he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[CHORUS (x2)]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation 
as a rock & roll star
I could do with the money
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
I'd send my photograph to my honey - and I'd c'mon like 
a regular superstar

I could fall asleep at night 
as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right 
as a rock & roll starDidn't know what time it was and the lights were low
I leaned back on my radio
Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll 'lotta soul, 
he said

Then the loud sound did seem to fade
Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase
That weren't no D.J. that was hazy cosmic jive

[CHORUS]
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
Cause he knows it's all worthwhile
He told me:
Let the children lose it
Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie

I had to phone someone so I picked on you
Hey, that's far out so you heard him too!
Switch on the TV 
we may pick him up on channel two
Look out your window I can see his light

If we can sparkle he may land tonight
Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright

[CHORUS (x2)]

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laHey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick 
Just put my spine out of place

Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she... then she...

[CHORUS]
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight...she's all right

Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes
Here she comes

[CHORUS]

A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City [x2]
Suffragette City 

Ohhh, Wham Bam Thank You Ma'am!

Suffragette City [ad lib]Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Wierd and Gilly, 
The Spiders from Mars. 
He played it left hand, but made it too far, 
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's Band.

Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling 
He could leave 'me to hang
Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan.

So where were the spiders while the fly tried to break our balls
Just the beer light to guide us,
So we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands 

Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass, he was the naz
With God given ass
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.

Making love with his ego Ziggy sucked up into his mind
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the rnan I had to break up the bandThere's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes.
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes.
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes.

There's such a fooled heart
Beatin' so fast
In search of new dreams.
A love that will last
Within your heart.
I'll place the moon
Within your heart.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down.

Falling.
Falling down.
Falling in love.

I'll paint you mornings of gold.
I'll spin you Valentine evenings.
Though we're strangers 'til now,
We're choosing the path
Between the stars.
I'll leave my love
Between the stars.

As the pain sweeps through,
Makes no sense for you.
Every thrill is gone.
Wasn't too much fun at all,
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down.

Falling
As the world falls down.
Falling
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling.
Falling.

Falling in love
As the world falls down.
Makes no sense at all.
Makes no sense to fall.
Falling
As the world falls down.
Falling.
Falling in love
As the world falls down.

Falling in love
As the world falls down.=====================

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)pressure pushing down on me
       pressing down on you no man ask for
       under pressure---that burns a building down
    splits a family in two
    puts people on streets
it's the terror of knowing
  what t
his world is about

watching some good friends
    screaming `let me out'
    pray tomorrow---gets me higher
    pressure on people---people on streets
 chippin' around---kick my brains around the floor
    these are the days 
it never rains but it pours
     people on streets---people on streets

it's the terror of knowing
  what this world is about
watching some good friends
    screaming `let me out'
    pray tomorrow---gets me higher

  pressure on people---people on streets
  turned away from it all like a blind man
  sat on a fence but it don't work
     keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
   why---why---why
LOVE
     insanity laughs un
der pressure we're cracking
   can't we give ourselves one more chance
       why can't we give love that one more chance
why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love
  'cause love's such an old fashioned word
    an
d love dares you to care for
       the people on the edge of the night
   and love dares you to change our way of
    caring about ourselves
    this is our last dance
    this is our last dance
 this is ourselves
    under pressure

    under pressure
  pressure.
queen & david bowie, "under pressure" (1981)you got crazy legs
     you got amazin' hair
    you got rings on your fingers
  and your hair's hot red
       you got wit from my tongue
  name on the sun
     i got you goin' to my breast
       'cause you're 
the only one
     who uses school for pleasure
you make me act real gone
  you make me troll along
    i have to ravish your capsule
     suck you dry
     feel the teeth in your bones
you give head with my own
i give
 up, i'm your whore
[ . . . ]
here all together
velvet goldmine
you stroke me like the rain
snake it, take it
but the princess you must stay
velvet goldmine
naked on your chain
i'll be your king volcano
writhe for you again and again
my velvet goldmine
you're my tricks, my trip
 i'll be your masters yet
i'll chop your hair off for kicks
   you'll make me jump to my feet
so when you give me your hand, give me your sound
let my sea wash your face
       i'm
 fallin', i can't stand
 put your mink on
velvet goldmine
you stroke me like the rain
snake it, take it
but the princess you must stay
velvet goldmine
naked on your chain
i'll be your king volcano
writhe for you again and again
my velvet go
ldmine

a lot of these lyrics are probably slightly wrong.  brackets indicate
a lyric i could not decipher for the life of me.  perhaps they're best
left uninterpreted.How you turn my world
You precious thing.
You starve and near exhaust me.

Everything I've done,
I've done for you.
I move the stars for no one.

You've run so long.
You've run so far.
Your eyes can be so cruel,
Just as I can be so cruel,
Oh I do believe in you.
Yes I do.

Live without your sunlight.
Love without your heartbeat.
(Falsetto) I... I...
Can't.. live.. within.. you...

I can't live within you

I...I..Can't live within you
